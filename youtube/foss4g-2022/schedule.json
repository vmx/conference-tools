The mission will be launched in 2023 and will allow us to see the Earth\u2019s global land mass each day in a wholly new way with more spectral bands, higher revisit, and at a higher resolution than ever before.

Applications for locating and classifying man-made objects, such as buildings, roads, aeroplanes, and cars typically require Very High Resolution (VHR) imagery, with spatial resolution ranging approximately from 0.3 m to 5 m. However, such VHR imagery is generally proprietary and commercially available at a high cost. This prevents its uptake from the wider community, in particular when analysis at large scale is desired. HIECTOR (HIErarchical deteCTOR) tackles the problem of efficiently scaling object detection in satellite imagery to large areas by leveraging the sparsity of such objects over the considered area-of-interest (AOI). This talk presents a hierarchical method for detection of man-made objects, using multiple satellite image sources with different Ground Sample Distance (GSD). The detection is carried out in a hierarchical fashion, starting at the lowest resolution and proceeding to the highest. Detections at each stage of the pyramid are used to request imagery and apply the detection at the next higher resolution, therefore reducing the amount of data required and processed. We evaluate HIECTOR for the task of building detection for a middle-eastern country, estimating oriented bounding boxes around each object of interest.\r\n\r\nFor the detection of buildings, HIECTOR is demonstrated using the following data sources: Sentinel-2 imagery with 10 m GSD, Airbus SPOT imagery pan-sharpened to 1.5 m pixel size and Airbus Pleiades imagery pan-sharpened to 0.5 m pixel size. Sentinel-2 imagery is openly available, making their use very cost efficient. The Single-Stage Rotation-Decoupled Detector (SSRDD) algorithm is used. Given that single buildings are not discernible at 10 m GSD, a bounding box does not describe a single building but rather a cluster of buildings. The estimated bounding boxes at 10 m are joined and the resulting polygon area is used to further request SPOT imagery at the pan-sharpened pixels size of 1.5 m. In the case of SPOT imagery, given the higher spatial resolution, one bounding box is estimated for each building. As a final step, predictions are improved in areas with low confidence by requesting Airbus Pleiades imagery at the pan-sharpened 0.5 m pixel size. Ablation studies show that HIECTOR achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 0.383 and 20-fold reduction in costs compared to using only VHR at the highest resolution, which achieves a mAP of 0.452.\r\n\r\nCode will be released under MIT license. We will also release the trained models on Sentinel, SPOT and Pleiades imagery. In addition, manually labelled building footprints over Dakar will be open-sourced to allow users evaluate the generalisation of the models over different geographical areas. The Sentinel Hub service is used by HIECTOR to request the commercial imagery sources on the specified polygons determined at each level of the pyramid, allowing to request, access and process specific sub-parts of the AOI.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "d2813efe-28cb-564f-b489-9d103c53e0cf", "id": 229, "code": "8Q7L99", "public_name": "Devis Peressutti", "avatar": "https://talks.osgeo.org/media/avatars/DevisPeressutti_3Ktq7vK.jpg", "biography": "Data Scientist at Sinergise developing open-source tools and applications leveraging satellite imagery.", "answers": []}, {"guid": "16a4d815-e678-5a7d-b31c-06f95d76dfc2", "id": 233, "code": "JWAQ8U", "public_name": "Nejc Vesel", "avatar": null, "biography": null, "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"url": "https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/EALH73/", "id": 304, "guid": "3a5012c9-7b76-54e3-ae1f-8f273e28f9ff", "date": "2022-08-24T15:15:00+02:00", "start": "15:15", "logo": null, "duration": "00:30", "room": "Auditorium", "slug": "foss4g-2022-304-no-code-geoai", "title": "No-code geoAI", "subtitle": "", "track": "AI4EO Challenges & Opportunities", "type": "General session talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made an impact in almost every field and has become an incredibly powerful technology.

Collectively, these could represent a major breakthrough, as it has been proven time and time again that many businesses and organisations still struggle to implement AI to its full potential and scale.\r\n\r\nVisual, often drag-and-drop, no-code AI tools can make AI less intimidating and more comprehensible to non-technical profiles and those who lack the time and resources to build such systems from the ground up. No-code AI frameworks are expected to require minimum technical knowledge to develop practical AI solutions at scale. This is an emerging field, like was previously the case with no-code web development, starting with Dreamweaver and MS Frontpage, the first WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) solutions, both launched in 1997. \r\n\r\nThe European Commission is supporting the establishment of an AI-on-demand platform that will provide easy and simple access to AI tools that are made in Europe and are \u2018trustworthy\u2019. The platform will gather all the AI resources (algorithms and tools), and make them available to the potential users, businesses, and public administration, with the necessary services to facilitate their integration.\r\n\r\nWithin the context of the EU\u2019s commitment to trustworthy AI, we are exploring the landscape of AI solutions for non-experts, including no-code, low-code, AutoML and similar approaches, and evaluating them in an experimental setting via prototyping. Our findings are expected to inform the development of relevant European digital initiatives. For instance, we will consider how these emerging AI solutions for non-experts could be integrated and used in the context of digital infrastructures such as EuroGEOSS or the European Data Spaces. \r\n\r\nFurther democratization of AI will happen when domain experts without prior AI expertise are enabled to tap into high-quality data to solve complex problems on their own, with technical details being abstracted away, such as algorithm selection, model training, software frameworks, hardware dependencies, and platform aspects. We expect that open-source AI technologies for non-experts represent a step towards such a future.\r\n\r\nDuring the conference, we will present the initial results of our geoAI activity, including a high-level architecture and a stack expected to be composed of various open-source software tools and open standards for digital infrastructures, data engineering and AI development.

For example, an OGC Web Mapping Service (WMS) may provide an Exception as a valid XML response or\r\nin a error message written \"in-image\", or an error may render a blank image. \r\nA generic uptime checker may assume the service is functioning as from those requests and an HTTP status \"200\" is returned.\r\n\r\nOther OGC services may have specific QoS issues that are not directly obvious. A successful and valid \"OWS GetCapabilities\" response may not \r\nguarantee that individual services are functioning correctly. For example an OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) based on a dynamic database may \r\nreturn zero Features on a GetFeature response caused by issues in an underlying database. Even standard HTTP checkers supporting \"keywords\" \r\nmay not detect all failure cases in OGC web services. Many OGC services will have multiple \"layers\" or feature types, how to check them all?\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is a form of semantic checking and reporting specific to OGC services!\r\n\r\nGeoHealthCheck (GHC) is an Open Source (MIT) web-based framework through which OGC-based web services can be monitored. GHC is written in \r\nPython (with Flask) under the umbrella of the GeoPython GitHub Organization. It is currently an OSGeo Community Project.\r\n\r\nGHC consists of two parts: (1) a web-UI app (using Flask) through which OGC service endpoint\r\nURLs and their checks can be managed, plus for visualising monitoring-results and (2) a monitoring engine that executes scheduled \r\n\"health-checks\" on the OGC service endpoints. Both parts share a common database (via SQLAlchemy, usually SQLite or PostgreSQL). \r\nThe database also stores all historic results, allowing for various forms of reporting.\r\n\r\nGHC is extensible: at this moment of writing a plugin-system is developed for \"Probes\" in order to support an expanding number of \r\ncases for OGC specific requests and -checks.

The data schemas of a registry database can hold a complex set of relations and database objects which can be hard to set up within QGIS. This was the case with a waste soil transportation registry that we developed for the City of Tampere, Finland. The main goal of the registry is to optimize soil transportation from construction sites by communicating and making it visible what soil categories are available and needed where and when. The registry enables significant savings in transportation costs as well as substantial reductions in climate emissions.\r\n\r\nWhen the relational data model gets complex, you can deploy different strategies for setting up the workflows within QGIS. One possible solution is to use editable views and triggers for enabling user-friendly workflows in QGIS. This was the case in our soil registry project. The data model, as it was, would have forced the user to create multiple new features to the database tables when he/she just wanted to add a single soil transfer from one construction site to another. This was seen as too tedious when repeated constantly. The solution was to make a database view that the user could edit in QGIS, in addition to deploying database triggers for creating the right database features, with the proper data into the correct database tables.\r\n\r\nThis presentation seeks to show how the strategy was deployed and what challenges we met during the development.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "e8a0f70b-8ebc-5460-ba85-c315d4bda717", "id": 437, "code": "ZRRLEF", "public_name": "Lauri Kajan", "avatar": "https://talks.osgeo.org/media/avatars/lauri-768x768_YCJkH6u.jpeg", "biography": "Software developer at Gispo Oy", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"url": "https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/NSLFQ9/", "id": 509, "guid": "4ee811cd-4ff5-5294-bab9-0ce3a7cacd9d", "date": "2022-08-24T12:00:00+02:00", "start": "12:00", "logo": null, "duration": "00:30", "room": "Room Limonaia", "slug": "foss4g-2022-509-generation-of-3d-geometries-with-artificial-intelligence-for-the-prediction-of-volumetry-of-the-urban-code-of-the-city-of-buenos-aires", "title": "Generation of 3D geometries with Artificial Intelligence for the prediction of volumetry of the Urban Code of the City of Buenos Aires", "subtitle": "", "track": "Use cases & applications", "type": "General session talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "To make the Platform possible and meet the objectives set, it was necessary to work with different areas of the government involved in urban planning and systems, promoting the opening of data to generate a sustainable process over time for the automatic and dynamic system of interpretation of the Urban Code that governs the constructive and urban behavior of the city of Buenos Aires, which is the basis of this technological solution.\r\nThe platform is based on the \u201cDigital Twin\u201d concept, that is, a virtual and digital replica of a city's urban plan.

The new system is built partly using existing open source components and partly on newly built open source components. It uses significantly less resources and lets third party users access the data in a standardized way.\r\n\r\nAn important part of the process has been to develop and propose a community STAC extension for perspective imagery. This extends the STAC base metadata with parameters which are needed to do photogrammetric calculations and measurements using the images. The potential of this extension is that it enables the community to build generic perspective imagery clients in which the user can do advanced photogrammetric measurements.\r\n\r\nTo  ensure support for existing clients and to lower the barrier to entry the system also supports clients without COG reading abilities.

So the challenge was to be able to efficiently read the GRASS GIS database directly with GeoServer. And why is that? Because this directly links the analytical capabilities of GRASS GIS with the exceptional geo service & publishing capabilities of GeoServer.\r\n\r\nOur approach is to use the existing GDAL-GRASS bridge, and add this bridge as a new extension to GeoServer.

The research project described in this talk undertook an analysis of the national paths network using publicly available data supplied by hundreds of individual local authorities across the UK. This was done by setting up a series of models in the QGIS Graphical Modeler to generate six key indicators aggregated to census area level, including distance to nearest continuous path from each small area unit of population,  length of available path within a series of buffers, and access to paths of specific types \u2013 for example those passing through protected or designated areas.

The intention is that these models could be run on smaller areas, and on hypothetical paths networks, to help build a case for extensions and rationalisation of the paths network at both national and local levels.

Technical specifications and guidelines describe the key components of data content and of implementation of web services. However, each country decides individually how technically it will implement these requirements, what architecture and software it will choose to use. The roadmap of directive implementation has reached the last milestone in 21/10/2020 \u2013 all spatial data sets had to be provided to the INSPIRE geoportal ((https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/). Now is the best time to share the experience how Lithuania started INSPIRE implementation path using commercial software but successfully ended with using only FOSS4G.\r\n\r\nImplementation of INSPIRE directive in Lithuania is centralized and state enterprise GIS-Centras is responsible for technical work. INSPIRE directive was implemented in 2 stages. The first stage started back in 2012 and it was dedicated to cover data sets from Annex I and Annex II (only orthophoto imagery). Back then the INSPIRE directive implementation was a new and little-known technical challenge. The decision to call a tender and use the commercial software for which there were not many viable alternatives at the time seemed quite logical. \r\n\r\nThe second stage of INSPIRE directive implementation started in 2018 and ended up in 2021. This stage was dedicated to cover data sets from Annex III and part of Annex II. Instead of just calling a tender to implement the requirements with commercial software we already had we decided to implement everything by ourselves and change the commercial software to FOSS4G. At the end of the project, we have not only prepared and published all the datasets and services, but also had a team of in-house specialists who were able to work with the FOSS4G. Even the results from the first stage was quickly changed to FOSS4G in order to unify the implementation architecture.\r\n\r\nWe have set three goals for the transition from commercial software to FOSS4G:\r\n1. Create a system that we can administer and develop ourselves;\r\n2. Create infrastructure that is cost-effective in the long run;\r\n3. Automate the workflow as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will share our experience of transition from commercial software to FOSS4G both from technological and company/team perspectives. We will present the technological architecture we use to implement INSPIRE requirements. It consist of PostGIS, Geoserver, QGIS, Hale studio, GDAL and Geonetwork.

It supports large team in-the-field mobile data collection, provides tools for data syncing and management, and easy visualisation and querying of spatial information for decision making and reporting. The workflow has been developed and deployed in Tonga through a collaboration between universities in Australia and the South Pacific, and Tonga\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Forests and Fisheries (MAFF). Maplandscape is currently being used in Tonga to map crop, livestock, agroforestry systems, and farm management practices; over 11,000 farms and four island groups have been mapped so far. This information has been used to inform agricultural planning and resource allocation, disaster response, land utilisation assessment, tracking land use changes, and monitoring of the condition of key commercial crops. \r\n\r\nThe Maplandscape workflow is based on QField for in-the-field data collection and QFieldCloud for data syncing, storage, and user authentication and management. Using QField mobile GIS, key agricultural landscape features (e.g. crop parcels, paddocks, fallow land) can be spatially mapped, and rich attribute information can be captured through various widgets and flexible and complex form logic, with support of reference geospatial layers. Three cloud-based applications have been developed that build on top of the QFieldCloud API to provide geospatial data visualisation and analytics tools. These applications provide differing and complementary functionalities, and facilitate quick analysis, publishing, and reporting of data collected using QField and stored using QFieldCloud. The apps are built using Shiny, Leaflet, ggplot, and DataTables software, and are deployed using ShinyProxy and docker containers in swarm mode. These applications use the QFieldCloud API to authenticate users and retrieve data and an R package has been developed to handle this interaction within Shiny apps. The goal of these applications is to speed up the process of data collected using QField informing agricultural monitoring, planning, and decision making activities. A summary of these geospatial data visualisation and analytics applications is provided below.\r\n\r\nmaplandscape-view is a web app that allows users to query and view spatial data on interactive maps and data tables and generate reports comprising cartographic outputs, charts, and summary tables directly from QFieldCloud data. maplandscape is a web app that allows users to specify and apply custom geospatial data querying, analysis, and visualisation tasks to their QFieldCloud data in a web browser and with a simple UI interface. This application enables users without a GIS background to extract information from, and analyse, rich datasets collected in-the-field using QField; for example, agricultural officials in Tonga used this application to generate village- and district-level crop area summary tables for their annual report.

Originally intended for archaeology, this platform saw cross-disciplinary adoption including disciplines such as oral tradition, linguistics, ecology and geochemistry.  Mobile GIS (provided by Nutiteq, Estonia) was built into the core software from the start providing the most essential geospatial functionality from management and rendering user-owned raster and vector data, to manual data creation, editing, retrieval, and rendering. Automated data collection via onboard and bluetooth sensors was also implemented to support unique identifier generation and printing, and other key tasks for field sample tracking.  Navigation and spatial query facility existed. The simplified interface isolated end-users from administrators, with only the latter needing geospatial skills and domain knowledge, a division that facilitated data entry by unskilled volunteers. Many of the geospatial functions, however, required programming to customize. Given this barrier to entry, only clients with access to a programmer could create customisations for geospatially-tailored field data entry. Others had to run existing customisations, published on Github. Despite this bottleneck, FAIMS 2.6 clients created a variety of spatial data collection workflows, from simple offline shape mapping to manual map data digitisation.\r\nIn 2022, FAIMS project is rebuilding the FAIMS Mobile platform to equip it with a graphic user interface for customisation, to allow cross-platform deployment, and to implement \u2018round trip\u2019 data transfer to and from  existing desktop tools.

Spatial knowledge graphs model locations and how they are spatially related to each other according to semantic properties and are useful for helping to automate the integration of geographic data across silos.

Within a single area, different programs collect and store different geographic data in siloed systems at different times, leading to discrepancies and duplication of effort. This also results in decisions based on incomplete and out-of-date geographic data (e.g., spatial distribution of population and resources).\r\n\r\nGeoPrism Registry is an open-source Common Geo-Registry (CGR) implementation that utilizes spatial knowledge graphs to provide a single source of truth for managing geographic data over time across multiple information systems and data sources.

Supervised algorithms (e.g.,  Random Forests or Support Vector Machine) that process pixels that can be parameterised by the users through a simple configuration file. iota2 also offers the user the option of using a deep learning model.\r\nIn addition to the pixel approaches, contextual approaches are also proposed, with Autocontext [1] and OBIA (Object Based Image Analysis). Autocontext, based on RF, takes into account the context of a pixel in a window around its position. The OBIA approach exploits an input segmentation to classify objects directly.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the supervised classification approaches, iota2 is also able to produce indicator maps (biophysical variables) either by supervised regression or by using user-provided processors, diversifying the possibilities of using iota2.\r\n\r\nOne major interest in iota2 is it's ablility to deal with a huge amount a data, for instance the OSO product (https://theia.cnes.fr/atdistrib/rocket/#/collections/OSO/2327b748-a82c-5933-afb0-087bbfeff4cd) is generated using a stack of all available Sentinel-2 data over the France without any landscape discontinuity due to the Sentinel-2 grid.

Current solutions for processing such data sets largely focus on horizontal scaling approaches on, for example, distributed systems such as the Cloud, without fully exploiting the opportunities offered by modern computing architecture. Furthermore, the variety of formats and types of geospatial data often result in complex processing workflows composed of multiple tools for reading and writing, transformation, processing, and resource management. We present an introduction, overview, and demonstration of the open-source Geostack framework (gitlab.com/geostack/library). This has been developed to help simplify many common operations, provide economy of code and to transparently take advantage of modern CPU/GPU hardware. We have aimed to provide three main routes to simplify and accelerate geospatial processing. These are: 1) a unified interface to read vector and raster data and interoperate between them, with no software dependencies for common geospatial data formats, 2) treatment of all data as objects independent of geospatial transforms, with transparent resource management through an underlying tile-based caching system, reprojection and interpolation carried out where needed, 3) extensive use of OpenCL to provide computational acceleration and automatic processing vectorisation on GPUs and multi-core CPUs as well as user-defined scripts to be executed over these objects. The framework also includes many common geospatial operations as well as several base geospatial solvers (including moving fronts, flow networks, particle modelling) accelerated using OpenCL. Geostack is a C++ API with Python bindings, the code examples and demonstrations are presented in Python. The Python bindings are available through conda and fully interoperable with common Python libraries including numpy, gdal, xarray, netcdf, geopandas and sqlite, allowing users to use as much or as little of the Geostack functionality as required.

The first step was the use of PostgreSQL + PostGIS as the primary data storage solution, then the use of open standards such as OGC WMS and WFS for data sharing, then the use of QGIS as the main software for data acquisition, and finally, the development of DSGTools, QGIS plugin with several tools for data quality control and cartographic finishing.\r\n\r\nThe Geoinformation Production Management System (GPMS) comes as the latest addition to our open-source stack. It has two main goals: to manage the distribution of jobs between the staff automatically; and standardize workflows, layers, styles, tools, processes and parameters of each job. \r\n\r\nFor the first goal, the manager can create a profile for each team member, setting which parts of the workflow they are qualified to execute. When the user asks for a job, the system matches his qualifications with the available jobs on the current project and gives him the highest priority job. This, combined with the visualization of the live production status on QGIS, helps the manager improve resource allocation's decision management.\r\n\r\nFor the second goal, the manager can configure in detail each workflow, setting which database the job will be executed on, which layers the user needs to access, which styles are available for each layer, which QGIS Processes the user should run with pre-set parameters, which resources the user has access to, such as imagery and DEMs. GPMS also does the permission control in the PostgreSQL database based on the job the user currently is executing and allows spatial filtering, so the user only can work in a spatially defined subset of the data. In this way, when a user receives a job, he has everything he needs to complete it.\r\n\r\nAll the jobs information, such as user, start timestamp, end timestamp, and job parameters, are stored in the system, allowing the automatic generation of metadata compatible with Brazilian Standards and visualizations of the project's current state.\r\n\r\nAs the Brazilian Army Geographic Service has 5 Centers of Geoinformation, the use of a production management system helped with the standardization of procedures, since a standard configuration can be defined and replicated between centers to use the same consistent workflow, with the same database schema, same layers per job, same QGIS Styles, processes, parameters and so on.\r\n\r\nThe GPMS is available on Github on https://github.com/1cgeo/sap as a Node web service and requires a QGIS plugin for the client (https://github.com/1cgeo/Ferramentas_Producao) and a QGIS plugin for the manager (https://github.com/1cgeo/Ferramentas_Gerencia).", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "cdf23a37-4d4d-584f-9d33-3849cd3828a2", "id": 213, "code": "Q7C9LJ", "public_name": "Felipe de Carvalho Diniz", "avatar": "https://talks.osgeo.org/media/avatars/1594574517676_ugWX3rB.gif", "biography": "Captain Cartographic Engineer at Brazilian Army with specialisation in quality evaluation and quality management of Geospatial Data at the University of Ja\u00e9n and Master of Science in Geoinformatics at Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC) of the University of Twente in The Netherlands.

These lessons will not spread unless we begin to address the hesitancy in transitioning towards sharing data and results and the lack of applied experience with tools which make open collaboration easier. Transform to Open Science (TOPS) is a new NASA Science Mission Directorate initiative designed to spark a cultural shift to collaborative, inclusive science.\r\n\r\nNASA defines open science as a collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding. A system based on open science aims to make the scientific process as transparent (or open) as possible by making all elements of a claimed discovery readily accessible, which enables results to be repeated and validated.\r\n\r\nOut of this open science concept, an evolving paradigm called open-source science is emerging. Open-source science accelerates discovery by conducting science openly from project initiation through implementation. The result is the inclusion of a wider, more diverse community in the scientific process as close to the start of research activities as possible. This increased level of commitment to conducting the full research process openly and without restriction enhances transparency and reproducibility, which engenders trust in the scientific process. It also represents a cultural shift that encourages collaboration and participation among practitioners of diverse backgrounds, including scientific discipline, gender, ethnicity, and expertise.\r\n\r\nWithin NASA\u2019s Open-source Science Initiative, TOPS provides the visibility, advocacy, and community resources to support and enable the shift to open-source science; NASA is designating 2023 as the Year of Open Science, a global community initiative to spark change and inspire open science engagement through events and activities that will shift the current paradigm. TOPS seeks to enable science that is accessible, inclusive and reproducible via four activities: providing high-level visibility to open science activities at NASA and beyond; developing an open science curriculum through a collaborative, community-driven model that will be fully and openly available virtually and at conferences; incentivizing open science activities via mechanisms such as partnerships, badging programs, and awards; and instigating a transformation of NASA\u2019s culture to better recognize and reward open science activities.\r\n\r\nTOPS advocates for open science as it builds trust, advances understanding, and ultimately leads to new knowledge production and important new discoveries. To enable open science, the TOPS is developing resources and activities that will support and enable the scientific community to move forward.

Unavailability and temporal non-reliability of controlled datasets are some of the reasons OSM data quality is still a concern. OSM is an ever-evolving digital space that has complex interconnectedness with physical space. To understand this interconnectedness we have to go back to the fundamentals and understand the genealogy of OSM with different qualitative and quantitative lenses. In this talk, I would like to present a research vision on how we can apply these quali-quantitative lenses to conceptualize the data quality of OSM to reduce the dependency on controlled or authoritative datasets. I will shed light on the layered conceptualization of OSM data quality with respect to different case study areas and projects that I am currently exploring. Layered conceptualization is based on the hypothesis that OSM data should be intertwined with the region and context-specific considerations. Understanding this intertwining will result in a better understanding of OSM data ethics and how it is related to the current data quality criteria already existing for OSM and other geo datasets.

PgHydro aims for an add-on implementation on a spatial database management system performed by a series of tables, queries, functions or views that can be used individually to assist in water resources decision making. These objects are the hydrography core of the intelligence system developed using free open source software that can be used by any person who deals with water resources management. To this end, this new conceptual model was implemented in the object-relational spatial database management system PostgreSQL/PostGIS respecting the integrity constraints related to the geometry of the mapped objects. These user-defined constraints respect the logical objects based on the Pfafstetter basin coding system and integrity constraints linked to the spatial relationships between objects, which follow the ISO SQL/MM specifications. The main advantage of using the pghydro extension is the possibility to process large datasets and complex queries using a more simple hydrography model and the tools and languages already available in spatial database management systems that work as a framework for the future development of new extensions related to water resources.\r\nThe pghydro functionalities can be run using a GUI developed in a QGIS plugin called PgHydro Tools. After the physical implementation of the pgHydro Scheme in the spatial database management system, the construction of the Pfafsteter hydrography dataset is started using the hydrography objects that make up the pgHydro Tools. The construction of this base is divided into seven stages: 1) Creation of the spatial database and creation of the pghydro extension; 2) insertion of the drainage lines and the drainage areas in the spatial database; 3) verification of the consistency of the drainage network geometries and topologies; 4) verification of the consistency of the drainage areas geometries and topologies; 5) verification of the consistency of topology between the drainage network and the drainage areas; 6) Pfafstetter basin coding and other information, finally; 7) export of the final Pfafstetter hydrography dataset.

The Directive requires Member States public organisations to make geospatial datasets in scope (i.e. belonging to 34 cross-sector categories known as data themes) interoperable, discoverable and accessible through view and download services. Fifteen years after the entry into force of the Directive, we assess the state of play, reflect on the lessons learned and, leveraging on these while also considering the current policy and technological context, elaborate a vision for the future evolution.\r\nThrough its Geoportal, which regularly harvests the EU Member States national catalogues, the INSPIRE infrastructure currently provides access to approximately 90 thousand datasets. The amount and update of those datasets is steadily increasing as is the fraction of datasets whose metadata, data models and view/download services are compliant to the legal requirements of the Directive. The INSPIRE infrastructure is currently based on three so-called central components, which in turn are implementations of reusable and mature open source software solutions: the INSPIRE Reference Validator makes use of the ETF testing framework, the INSPIRE Registry is based on the Re3gistry software (included in the OSGeo Live since 2021) and the INSPIRE Geoportal is currently being migrated to GeoNetwork  . INSPIRE has also played a key standardisation role in Europe by fully promoting and relying on open standards, mainly by ISO and OGC. Finally, an active and engaged community of stakeholders, meeting at the annual INSPIRE Conference and other related ad-hoc events, has highly favoured the policy and technological development.\r\nDespite many pros, lessons learned from INSPIRE also show some cons. These include e.g. overspecification in legislation (often leading to extensions to existing standards) which still limit implementation, and the lack of a common approach to data licensing. In addition, the current technological landscape is very different from the one from the INSPIRE dawn. New data sources (Internet of Things, citizen-generated and Earth Observation data, research data and data owned by businesses), new agile standards (e.g. OGC APIs for data sharing and modern standards for data encoding) and novel architectures (cloud, edge and fog computing) are creating an opportunity that INSPIRE shall leverage to remain relevant and fit-for-purpose. In parallel, driven by the recent European Strategy for Data, the current European policy context and related legislative instruments are strongly pushing for an increased, better and fairer use of all available data for the benefit of European economy and society.\r\nWithin this context, the talk will illustrate our vision to streamline and simplify the technological and organisational structure of INSPIRE towards a data-driven and self-sustainable ecosystem. We will mainly reflect on the key role played by open source software, open standards and open licenses, and on the need to redefine the governance of the infrastructure through the increasing involvement of open source communities, including OSGeo as a strategic partner.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "3fef265d-39a6-539f-868e-553f1dcd7379", "id": 5, "code": "GQL9US", "public_name": "Marco Minghini", "avatar": "https://talks.osgeo.org/media/avatars/Marco_lgMHSCm.png", "biography": "Dr. Marco Minghini obtained a BSc degree (2008), an MSc degree (2010) and a PhD degree (2014) in Environmental Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

The INSPIRE Geoportal (https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu) constitutes its main component, being the central point of access to all datasets published by EU Member States falling under the scope of the Directive. Using the INSPIRE Geoportal, users can search for, access, visualize and download datasets published by more than 7000 data providers from across Europe.\r\nIn line with the open source strategy of the European Commission and the ambition towards a sustainable evolution of the INSPIRE infrastructure based on open source components, since 2021 the INSPIRE Geoportal is has been revamped by using cutting-edge, open source applications and open standards, while redesigning the way in which information and services are offered to users. \r\nThe process comprises deep changes in the Geoportal backend, totally renovating the underlying catalogue application: management interface, powerful harvesting engine, set of metadata, data and service linking tests, search engine, automatic metadata translation capabilities, containerization and deployment in a cloud environment. In addition, a new frontend (user interface) is integrated with the mentioned backend using APIs, making both layers more independent in terms of technological stack and update cycles.  \r\nThe application selected for achieving these goals is GeoNetwork opensource, currently constituting the catalogue choice of around 80% of Member States national geospatial data portals in the EU. Since its inception in 2001, it has been developed with a strong focus on international standards and many new features have been added over the years.\r\nDuring the last year, the GeoCat staff and the INSPIRE team at the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre have closely collaborated in the development of a new powerful and versatile system for delivering the revamped INSPIRE Geoportal, contributing the improvements \u2013 to the maximum possible extent \u2013 to the core of GeoNetwork to maximize their exploitation by the geospatial community. \r\nMore in detail, the system encompasses a high-performance harvesting system based on a microservices, including link validation and reporting functionality. All these pieces have been developed as separate components, which can be scaled independently from other components within a GeoNetwork-based infrastructure. Performance and compliance to the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines formed part of the key requirements of the work. As a result, GeoNetwork capabilities for supporting the INSPIRE Directive will be substantially improved and completed in the toolkit. This, in turn, will also improve the transparency and collaboration between the national authorities and the European level.\r\nAt the end of this transitional phase for the INSPIRE Geoportal, foreseen by mid-2022, the project will deliver tangible benefits.

Solutions are very much tied to platforms operated and controlled by big tech (Earth Engine, Planetary Computer), particular programming languages, software stacks and/or file formats (xarray, Pangeo, ODC, GeoPySpark/GeoTrellis). The openEO initiative provides an API and a set of processes that separate the \u201cwhat\u201d from the \u201chow\u201d: users specify what they want to compute, and back-end processing engines decide how to do this. The openEO API is OpenAPI compliant, and has client interfaces for Python, R, and JavaScript, and in addition graphical user interfaces running in the browser or in QGIS. The underlying data model is that of a data cube view: image collections or vector data may be stored as they are, but are analysed as if they were laid out as a raster or vector data cube, e.g. for raster with dimensions x, y, band and time, or for vector with dimensions geometry, band and time. Because openEO assumes that imagery is described as STAC collections and the implementation is composed of open source components, it is relatively easy to set it up and compute on infrastructure where imagery is available through a STAC interface. Having a single interface to carry out computations on back-ends with different architecture makes it possible to compare results across implementations, to verify that EO processing is reproducible. So far, over 100 processes have been defined, and user-defined functions written in Python or R extend this ad infinitum. openEO was initially developed during a H2020 project (2017-2020). It is currently continued with ESA funding that has resulted in the \u201copenEO Platform\u201d, an implementation run by VITO and EODC where the general public can use the openEO interface for large scale computations. Several upcoming Horizon Europe projects will further support continued development of the API and openEO software ecosystem of clients and back-ends.

The four main pillars of the initiative are: i) EO Digital Platforms, interoperability and standardisation, ii) Accessible and Reproducible EO Science, iii) Inclusive and collaborative research and iv) Strategic Partnerships. Contributing to the second pillar, ESA is developing an EO Open Science Catalogue tool to enhance the discoverability and use of products, data and knowledge resulting from Scientific Earth Observation exploitation studies.

As of recently, ECMWF started the move towards serving data to users beyond operational forecasters in Member states and commercial customers for a charge, by adopting an open data policy which will be implemented in phases from 2020 to 2025. The first phase included opening hundreds of [web forecast charts](https://apps.ecmwf.int/webapps/opencharts) and making archived data available under a Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0) open licence in 2020. The next step was in January 2022 when the production of [open subset of real time medium range forecast](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/open-data) began. \r\n\r\nThis phased move towards free and open data aims to support creativity and innovation in the field of scientific research as well as weather applications. It also represents a step towards more reproducible open science. However this can not be achieved by only opening the real time data. The users need to be able to find and easily use the data and integrate it into their own research work or application workflows. Reliable access to the data is achieved by making it available both through ECMWF https service and via the Microsoft Azure cloud, where the archived data is kept as well.\r\n\r\nIn order for the data to be more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), additional development work is being done. This work includes the design of an [API](https://github.com/ecmwf/ecmwf-opendata) to easily download the geospatial data, and the development of open source Python libraries to [process](https://github.com/ecmwf/ecmwf-data) and [visualise](https://github.com/ecmwf/magpye) it.

EFAS and GloFAS aims to complement national and regional service by providing medium-range flood forecasts and hydrological outlooks for large, transboundary rivers. Data and products are accessible to eligible users through the Climate Data Store and dedicated web interfaces. ECMWF, having the role of the computational centre within CEMS, is responsible for running the forecasts and the post-processing, on top of co-developing and hosting the EFAS and GloFAS information systems.\r\n\r\nThese two information systems consist on back-end/front-end web services based on OGC standards and open-source software. As it is often the case, a web-based mapviewer allows to display different layers, produced by a WMS back-end. These layers are the graphical representation of the output of the hydrological models and meteorological observations, like flood probability, soil moisture, return period, observed precipitation etc. For most layers a new forecast is produced every 12 hours for EFAS and every 24 hours for GloFAS.\r\n\r\nUnlike many similar services, however, the aim of EFAS and GloFAS is not only to offer the latest forecasts or the latest observations but also to browse through data from previous days, so that older forecasts can be compared with actual observed events. This inherently means supporting the time dimension within the WMS standard, and managing large quantity of data that accumulates every day. In the case of EFAS, for example, an additional 1.5 Gb of data is produced twice a day.\r\n\r\nIt also means handling the inevitable changes in data formats and structures that arise as the service grows and new features are added, without breaking backward compatibility. New layers are added, old layers are removed, changes in the geographical domain or the projection for a certain layer must be supported from a certain date onward, etc. Not to mention increasing the number of forecast cycles from one per day to two or more.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, data access must be restricted on both front-end and back-end based on a matrix of user privileges, requested product and requested date. For example some layers are offered to all users with no time restrictions, while others are restricted to some users for the latest 30 days, and freely accessible to all users for dates older than 30 days ago.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we describe the challenges of developing and operating an authentication-aware web service heavily based on large geospatial datasets with a strong diachronic component.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "adc0feef-b22e-56ca-8ea4-330cc38a7883", "id": 333, "code": "QR38XY", "public_name": "Dimitar Tasev", "avatar": null, "biography": "Full stack web developer for EFAS", "answers": []}, {"guid": "ee2d2e26-3f3d-545f-a0d2-4e0d7eab2aa1", "id": 334, "code": "8ZU8N7", "public_name": "Paolo Battino", "avatar": null, "biography": "Currently a web developer at the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF).", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}], "Room Verde": [{"url": "https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/RU7PYN/", "id": 258, "guid": "7708d218-1e02-5026-8a4e-88c0beceb95e", "date": "2022-08-25T09:00:00+02:00", "start": "09:00", "logo": null, "duration": "00:30", "room": "Room Verde", "slug": "foss4g-2022-258-state-of-grass-gis", "title": "State of GRASS GIS", "subtitle": "", "track": "State of software", "type": "General session talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "The new GRASS GIS version 8.2 is a special edition including all new features developed during Google Summer of Code 2021.

It is available on multiple platforms, Linux, Windows and MacOs, and was developed primarily by CNES (French Space Agency) and CS Group in the frame of the development of the ORFEO program (French and Italian support program for Pleiades and Cosmo-Skymed).  \r\n\r\nOTB can process large images thanks to its built-in streaming and multithreading mechanisms. Its data processing schema is primarily based on ITK pipelines, and uses GDAL dependency to read and write raster and vector data. Many formats are supported by the library (at least those supported by GDAL) as CosmoSkyMed, Formosat, Ikonos, Pleiades, QuickBird,  Radarsat 2, Sentinel 1, Spot5, Spot 6/7, TerraSarX or WorldView 2.  \r\n\r\nOTB provides a lot of applications to process optical and SAR products: ortho-rectification, calibration, pansharpening, classification, large-scale segmentation and more. The library is written in C++ but all the applications can also be accessed from Python, command line launcher, QGIS and Monterverdi, a powerful satellite image visualization tool bundled in the OTB packages capable of manipulating large images efficiently. \r\n\r\nThe library also facilitates external contributions thanks to the remote module functionality: users can add new applications without modifying the core of the library. If this new remote module is relevant, it could be added as an official remote module, like DiapOTB (differential SAR interferometric processing chain) and OTBTensorflow (multi-purpose deep learning framework, targeting remote sensing images processing). \r\n\r\nMoreover, several operational image processing chains are based on OTB: their algorithms use the framework of OTB Applications while the orchestration is written in python. Some of the chains are also open source: Let It Snow (Snow cover detection), iota2 (Large Scale Land Surface Classification), WASP (Multitemp images fusion), S1Tiling (Sentinel-1 calibration and MAJA (Maccs-Atcor Joint Algorithm). The Orfeo Toolbox is also a part of the Sentinel 2 ground segment, being integrated in the S2 Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) module where it is used for radiometric corrections and resampling. \r\n\r\nIn the latest releases (from 7.x to 8.0), several features have been added as new SAR sensor models and new applications, and the OSSIM dependency - used for geometric sensor modelling and metadata parsing \u2013 has been removed in favor of functionalities available in GDAL.

Indeed, its image processing functionalities (multithreading, streaming, ram configuration) allow to process big images quite fast. The operational processing chains use OTB from the Python API and C++ API.  \r\n\r\nAmong the optical chain processing using OTB, we can list: MAJA, WASP, BIOPHY and IOTA2. MAJA (Maccs-Atcor Joint Algorithm) is an atmospheric correction and cloud screening software, based on multi temporal and multi-spectral processing. This chain uses L1C products to generate high quality L2A surface reflectance time series for Landsat8, Venus, and Sentinel 2 missions, it is mainly used by THEIA distribution center. The core algorithms of Maja are based on the Orfeo Toolbox. To process a product, the chain uses aerosol contents, cloud and shadow detection and various atmospheric effects to estimate accurate surface reflectance values. The main problem of the L2A products is the presence of clouds in time series which is why WASP was created. Indeed WASP (Weighted Average Synthesis Processor) delivers L3 products which provide monthly syntheses of cloud-free reflectance for Sentinel2 and Venus L2A products distributed by THEIA. This processor mainly includes a directional correction to normalize data and a weighted average of surface reflectance. Two other operational chains which uses OTB are BIOPHY - the goal of this processing chain is to create L2A products containing biophysical variables (FAPAR, FCOVER, LAI) related to the presence of vegetation in the image over a year \u2013 and IOTA2 - a soil occupation processor over a year of Sentinel1 and Sentinel2 data, the algorithms use the classification toolbox provided by OTB to process large areas, to determine the areas covered by buildings. \r\n\r\nOrfeoToolBox is also used for radar processing chain, like diapOTB or S1Tiling. S1TIling is a generic processing chain for Sentinel-1 time series developed with open-source software. Its main goal is to produce time series of Analysis ready data S1 images for large areas. The algorithms are using the SAR processing toolbox from OTB to take profit of its in-memory pipelining capabilities. DiapOTB is a differential SAR interferometry processing. It uses two SAR images of the same portion of the Earth\u2019s surface taken at different time as input and aims to analyze potential events (earthquake, destruction \u2026) by highlighting differences between SAR images. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, OTB is the central framework for a large scale of operational chains in remote sensing. Its genericity permits to cover a lot of use cases in one single tool.

For Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) and its partners, open imagery has been critical for disaster response and preparedness mapping projects. Those images have traditionally been difficult to share and access because of the large file sizes and technical skills required to publish them online. Since its inception, OAM provides an easy means of contributing to and accessing a large repository of open imagery, with over 11,000 images added. The OAM browser is designed to easily index, visualize and filter images, while the data itself is stored in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format in the Open Imagery Network, a federated network of highly available imagery buckets from different cloud providers. \r\n\r\nOpenAerialMap is the only platform built on open-source software that allows anyone to upload and share aerial imagery of anywhere on Earth. With advances in drone mapping technologies and their proliferation in places where cost and access used to be a limiting factor, there are now massive amounts of images that can be easily made available through OAM. Once uploaded, all imagery becomes instantly accessible via scalable TMS and WMTS services for mapping in OpenStreetMap or for any other use. Since its creation, OAM has been democratizing high resolution Earth observation and promoting the sharing of aerial imagery through open data licenses.\r\n\r\nThis year HOT joined with Kontur to take a fresh look at OAM and redesign the platform. Using modern, equitable, human-centered design principles, we evaluated how this tool could be used to better support HOT\u2019s vision that everyone has access to high quality map data and can use that data responsibly to improve their lives and their communities.

This means that the border of the new object is spatially not touched/changed when two surfaces are merged. With simple feature the common border must be computed on the fly, which again may involve snapTo and cause tiny overlaps and gaps. \r\n\r\nWith Postgis Topology you can easily make an API where the client only sends new borders which is a key issue to secure data integrity. This secures that old border are not are not moved by a client error or the by simple transport format, because existing points are never not passed back to the server. Postgis Topology makes it easy for the server to work with those new borders(delta), because there are standard methods for this in Postgis Topology and all relations between border and surfaces are stored in the database. Postgis Topology also has validation routines in addition to using standard database constraints to secure a healthy system. \r\n\r\nThe principles that Postgis Topology is based on was used in spatial system many years ago, but one problem was to keep the border line work nice and clean and not end up in a spaghetti.  So one of the first things we did together with Sandro Santilli was to create methods on top of Postgis Topology to avoid this, by throwing away any border parts that does not contribute to a new \u201cvalid\u201d surface.\r\n\r\nPostgis Topology is built on a relational database model that is based on SQL-MM part 3. Your own domain data are easily linked to border, surface objects with more. For instance to check domain attributes on a surface on the other side of a border is not spatial query but a standard relational query. \r\n\r\nThe following projects will also be touched in this talk:\r\n\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/nibioopensource/pgtopo_update_sql (Functions using Postgis Topology to make it easy to create spatial update clients.)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/strk/qgis_pgis_topoedit (Postgis Topology is very well integrated with QGIS.)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/larsop/resolve-overlap-and-gap (Show how we clean up,  simplify, generalize  simple feature tables with millions of rows using Postgis Topology)\r\n\r\nIs relational database structure a good choice for Postgis Topology? Yes I will mean and since it\u2019s also linked up SQL-MM part3 and not a random private structure and with all great Postgis functions available this is very good combination. You may take take glance at https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/reldb/ and other articles about relational databases. \r\n\r\nThe plan now is to build a full ecosystem around Postgis Topology with a generic client to support declarative rules, where you can define attributes, rules for attribute handling and how to deal with overlap and gap. \r\n\r\nAll the work NIBIO has done/is doing here would not have been possible with out the great support from Sandro Santilli.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "f7f87a81-0375-513c-9fb5-817d41d0f954", "id": 406, "code": "QS7Y88", "public_name": "Lars Opsahl", "avatar": null, "biography": "Developer in SQL, Java and related tools for many years.

We tried to build solutions like filling empty values in inconsistent temporal data, and dividing the data in specified time period chunks for faster queries, while these worked as POC, they were not easy to scale up. Working with structured data was much easier to understand, working on postgres with the addition of timescale and PostGIS gave us exactly what was needed. Building the solution at the database level with the existing open-source technologies has been an exhilarating experience. \r\n\r\nImagine a dataset with hourly frequency going back years on a global level, with frequent inconsistencies, that not only you have to efficiently store but that should also be highly accessible in combination with other such datasets. If not for the open-source, we would not have been able to answer questions like:\r\n - How much have the lakes shrunk between the years 2010-2020 on a yearly basis?\r\n- Finding GHG emissions from biomass burning of \"*all US states, for the last 10 years on a monthly, weekly, daily basis***\".**\r\nLeveraging other open source solutions like h3-pg indexing also helped us to reduce the query time by an exponential factor for global level queries! \r\n\r\nWhile the database sounds pretty amazing, another challenge was putting it all together and deploying it on the cloud, which was a whole another challenge. The most intuitive solution was to deploy a bunch of Postgres instances. While it was not so hard to implement the basics, it became almost impossible to scale up or down, install rolling updates, account for failures. \r\n\r\nKeeping up with the tech, Kubernetes seemed like a great solution for building a high availability cluster service, and finding the postgres-operator (PGO) by crunchydata was exactly what we needed. It combined all the right tools like pgBouncer, pgBackRest, and monitoring solution using grafana and Prometheus all in one packaged easily to deploy service. While the learning curve with Kubernetes was a little steep, it lead to building a highly scalable and resilient database cluster.\r\n\r\nThe PostgreSQL + PostGIS + Timescale + H3 stack helped us simulate the temporal and spatial nature of the world at the database level and gave a universal approach to store and query all our datasets. It can handle textual data like fires with time (recorded time) and spatial information (lat -long) or shapes of counties, water bodies, etc., and combine them with each other using few joins giving us a very powerful geospatial-temporal query engine. \r\n\r\nWithout FOSS it would have been impossible to even imagine any of this but as of now, we are quantifying climate change!", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "851cf167-9d87-56dc-a280-4b5d7e575762", "id": 528, "code": "7UJ9GM", "public_name": "Jashanpreet Singh", "avatar": "https://talks.osgeo.org/media/avatars/jashan_JgAKcgC.jpeg", "biography": "Technical lead at BlueSky Analytics (building a catalogue of environmental datasets) I work with the entire stack from devops, APIs and frontend all in day's work!", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"url": "https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/WXJKDM/", "id": 519, "guid": "d774688b-3ae2-5124-9027-b76be5b16b21", "date": "2022-08-25T14:15:00+02:00", "start": "14:15", "logo": null, "duration": "00:30", "room": "Room Limonaia", "slug": "foss4g-2022-519-web-mapping-at-any-scale-bite-size-full-stack-cartography-with-protomaps-pmtiles-open-source-tools", "title": "Web mapping at any scale: Bite-size, full-stack cartography with Protomaps + PMTiles open source tools", "subtitle": "", "track": "State of software", "type": "General session talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "Protomaps is a new, open source set of tools for vector cartography on the web.

Within the \r\nOSGeo Community, it has been fostered by projects such as OpenLayers \r\nand Leaflet. They evolved tightly intertwined with the framework imposed by  \r\nfree data providers, initially around commercial efforts like Google and later \r\nOpenStreetMap. While useful in providing an easy entry to web mapping, and \r\nconvenient background layers, these data providers also triggered a regression \r\ntowards centuries-old cartography techniques, in particular the Mercator projection. \r\nThis has become a major hurdle to web mapping, particularly concerning global \r\ndata.    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Mercator map projection was created to aid sea faring in the XVI century and \r\nwas rendered useless with the advent of global positioning systems. Its use in \r\ncartography may still be acceptable at large scales, neighbourhood or city \r\nlevel, but at smaller scales it imposes severe distortion to distances and areas. \r\nFor global datasets in particular, the Mercator projection is unusable, for it \r\ncannot represent the full surface of the planet.   \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWeb mapping developers may work around this framework with libraries such as D3 \r\nor proj4js, and by setting up bespoke base layer services. But in doing so they \r\nface a different problem: the deep dependence on the CRS index created by the \r\nEuropean Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG). Primarily concerned with the survey and \r\nextraction of fossil fuels, the EPSG leans heavily on local or regional CRSs, \r\nlargely ignoring global CRSs.  Hardly any of the more than 100 map projections \r\nand coordinate systems developed since the beginning of the XX century feature \r\nin the EPSG index.  Landmark projections such as the Eckert series, the \r\nHomolosine, Eumorphic, Dymaxion or the Snyder series were never included in the \r\nEPSG index.  Not even the classical Mollweide projection (one of the turning \r\npoints towards modern cartography) appears in the EPSG index. With a FOSS4G \r\nstapple such as MapServer, this forces the leveraging of map (re-)projections to \r\nthe client, which is not always possible.     \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWeb mapping with global data thus remains a technical challenge with FOSS4G. \r\nThis address reviews several techniques and work-arounds making global web \r\nmapping possible with familiar FOSS4G technologies.

Moodle supports the creation of tests based upon a wide variety of question types (e.g. multiple choice, true/false, drag and drop markers, etc), which are stored in a question bank. The test is generated by randomly selecting a given number of questions; therefore, taking the test a couple of times is highly recommended.

The platform provides a programming environment that includes an agent-based modeling library (agentscript.org), a geo-aware programming context, and a map display (leafletjs.com). \r\n\r\nThe platform was designed to reduce the overhead needed for programmers to begin modeling. We want to empower modelers who come from a wide array of backgrounds with the ability to write and animate geospatial models with minimal time and effort. The intended audience of this platform are users who want to explore geospatial and agent-based modeling but may have little to no experience interacting with these types of models.\r\n\r\nWe use agent-based modeling as a basis for our platform since it is a popular way to teach programming and can model a wide spectrum of problems. Popularized by NetLogo and StarLogo, agent-based modeling is used in a variety of educational contexts from elementary school studies to graduate level research. To maximize deployability, our agent-based modeling library AgentScript was written in JavaScript and built to be leveraged by the web browser.\r\n\r\nGIS software is typically professional in nature and leans on being sophisticated and precise, but is often overburdened with complexity. The hobbyist GIS programmer faces a steep learning curve when starting, including choosing appropriate tools and information sources, deciding on data formats and understanding projections. Our platform intends on removing these burdens on the user by trading versatility for simplicity and ease of use.\r\n\r\nWe are preparing our platform to be used initially in academia, but can see it being applied in a variety of settings. AgentScriptGIS focuses on facilitating new ways to engage students, teachers and modelers with geospatial issues.

An example of applications in the North-Western Alps", "subtitle": "", "track": "Use cases & applications", "type": "General session talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "Rockfall risk analysis and mitigation activities are key points in land management in mountain areas and along coastal cliffs, aimed at the protection of population, structures, infrastructures and involved economic activities such as viability, industry and tourism. \r\nRockfall is a complex landslide phenomenon, widespread over large areas and characterised by high variability. As a function of the amount of available data to describe such variability, the risk analysis can be carried out at different levels of detail, i.e. at different reference scales, each one characterised by specific objectives, procedures, and input data (Fell et al, 2008).\r\nAt the detailed scale (> 1: 5000), in order to design risk mitigation works, it is necessary to analyse localized rockfall phenomena through specific methodologies requiring a careful identification of danger scenarios, a statistical description of the parameters, and sophisticated probabilistic calculation tools.\r\nAt the medium-large scale (1: 5000 - 1: 25000), on the contrary, due to the difficulty in finding detailed information over larger slope portions, it is possible to analyse widespread instability sources based on simplified mechanical considerations and several spatial approximations. Such large scale analyses can be used as a management tool for territorial planning and can be easily implemented in GIS software.\r\nThis work presents a medium-large scale Rockfall Quantitative Risk Assessment procedure fully developed within the QGIS environment. The procedure is based on the IMIRILAND methodology (Castelli and Scavia, 2008), which allows to obtain risk maps through integrated and consequential phases and simple raster calculations. The main steps of IMIRILAND methodology are:\r\n\u2022\thazard analysis, aimed at defining, for a given rockfall scenario, the potentially involved area, the intensity of the damaging phenomenon and the temporal probability of occurrence;\r\n\u2022\tidentification of the elements at risk and definition of their value and their exposure with reference to  physical, social, environmental and economic considerations;\r\n\u2022\tanalysis of the vulnerability of the elements at risk, i.e. the degree of loss of the element as a consequence of the impact with the falling block;\r\n\u2022\tcalculation of the risk, combining the hazard with value, exposure and vulnerability of the elements at risk.\r\nThe IMIRILAND QRA procedure was applied to the mountain site of Sorba Valley (VC), North-Western Alps. The site involves an area of about 10 km2 with altitudes ranging from 750 m up to 2035 m a.s.l. The site is prone to rockfall events, which historically involved some hamlets and some sections of the valley main road. However, very little information on such events is available, and no indication can be obtained in terms of rockfall recurrence and involved volumes. Due to this, it was not possible to take into account temporal aspects and relative (spatial) risk maps were produced in this work.\r\nAll the analysis was carried out using open data available as web services and datasets from the Regione Piemonte GeoPortal:\r\n\u2022\tDTM with 5 m x 5 m raster resolution \u2013 GeoPortale Piemonte;\r\n\u2022\tOrthophoto AGEA 2018 \u2013 GeoPortale Piemonte;\r\n\u2022\tPiemonte Land Cover BDTRE (Base Dati Territoriale di Riferimento degli Enti) \u2013 GeoPortale Piemonte;\r\n\u2022\tvehicular mobility TGM (Traffico Giornaliero Medio) \u2013 GeoPortale Piemonte.\r\nThree rockfall design scenarios were identified regarding homogeneous rockfall source areas associated with different design block volumes. Each scenario included more than 3600 source points, extracted through the analysis of the DTM (slope and aspect) and the observation of the orthophoto for the identification of rocky outcrop zones. For each scenario, a quick estimation of a time-independent hazard was performed using the QGIS QPROTO plugin (Castelli et al, 2021). The plugin is based on the Cone Method (Jaboyedoff and Labiouse, 2011) and runs a visibility analysis through the r.viewshed GRASS GIS module, combined with simplified topographic, geomorphological and mechanical considerations. The result of the analysis is a series of raster maps with the distribution of computed values of velocity, energy, and relative spatial hazard. \r\nThe following step of the IMIRILAND procedure is the analysis of the damage, based on the collection of information on the exposed elements. To this aim:\r\n\u2022\tthe elements at risk were classified according to various Land Cover categories from BDTRE, associated with relative hierarchical values. Physical and social values were taken into account for each element. Physical value is mainly linked with the type of element and with the reconstruction costs while social value is linked to the presence of persons and the social utility of the asset;\r\n\u2022\tthe physical exposure of the elements at risk was defined for each hazard scenario with reference to the computed runout area. The social exposure was defined taking into account the time spent by people inside buildings or on the roads. \r\n\u2022\tthe physical vulnerability of the elements at risk was defined on the basis of the intensity of the phenomenon in terms of rockfall energy and the type of element. The social vulnerability is the same as the physical one inside buildings and is 100% outside buildings. \r\nPhysical and social damage maps were then obtained for each hazard scenario through the product of the value, the exposure and the vulnerability of the elements located in the involved area. Due to the lack of information on the temporal probability of occurrence of the scenarios, damage maps correspond to relative, time-independent, risk maps. \r\nThe results show that the highest risk is concentrated in the inhabited areas and some portions of the valley road, according to the few historical information available on the site. \r\nThe QPROTO plugin is available at the GIT repository of FAUNALIA (gitlab.com/faunalia/QPROTO) and can be easily used by professionals, public administrators, managers of roads, railways or infrastructures for land planning purposes or for preliminary analyses aimed at defining the most critical zone of a wide area, where resources and more in-depth analyses can be focused for mitigation purposes.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "ec9328f2-aa88-5d7d-8166-4c9e36e96756", "id": 556, "code": "V9X98A", "public_name": "marta castelli", "avatar": null, "biography": null, "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}], "Room 4": [{"url": "https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/AXTEJZ/", "id": 32, "guid": "92c974ff-1ad0-50f4-ad21-17e5bc2e845c", "date": "2022-08-25T09:00:00+02:00", "start": "09:00", "logo": null, "duration": "00:30", "room": "Room 4", "slug": "foss4g-2022-32-districtbuilder-or-how-topojson-was-the-cause-of-and-solution-to-all-of-our-problems", "title": "DistrictBuilder, or how TopoJSON was the cause of and solution to all of our problems", "subtitle": "", "track": "Use cases & applications", "type": "General session talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "DistrictBuilder (districtbuilder.org) is a web-based, open-source tool for collaborative political boundary redistricting or redistribution.\r\n\r\nIn order to support creating legally valid districts, DistrictBuilder allows advocates and legislators to define districts using geometries as small as a single census block, which are very numerous \u2013 a medium-sized state will have hundreds of thousands of them.

In this talk we will present two exciting new features that have been added recently to the product related with the geospatial topic: vector tiles support and line and hexagon aggregations.\r\n\r\nVector tiles have become an industry standard to encode large amounts of data to be displayed in the browser by web mapping libraries like MapLibre or OpenLayers. Elasticsearch analytics & geo team has added a [new API endpoint] that renders search and aggregation queries as zipped [protobuffers], allowing developers to retrieve right from the datastore assets that are ready to be sent to the user's browser without much further processing. This will speed up the rendering of large datasets by avoiding transferring JSON assets from Elasticsearch to application middleware.\r\n\r\nElasticsearch geospatial aggregation capabilities have been extended recently by two new methods, one is to allow combining related points into a new [line geometry] (think of a vehicle track) and the other is to aggregate geometries into an [hexagon grid]. The new geo-line aggregation will be very useful for asset tracking use cases where the second enables Elasticsearch to perform powerful analytics combined with the extensive support for metric aggregations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will present this project, going through the different use cases with some examples and demonstrations using both Kibana [Elastic Maps] and a simple ad-hoc web project that leverages this new feature.\r\n\r\n[Elasticsearch]: https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/\r\n[protobuffers]: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers\r\n[line geometry]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-metrics-geo-line.html\r\n[hexagon grid]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/search-aggregations-bucket-geohexgrid-aggregation.html\r\n[new API endpoint]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-vector-tile-api.html\r\n[Elastic Maps]: https://www.elastic.co/maps", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "ed32a5f5-511b-50b3-b064-86bf000fba93", "id": 445, "code": "ES9EYE", "public_name": "Jorge Sanz", "avatar": "https://talks.osgeo.org/media/avatars/20190731_panpan_u7EbkUx.jpg", "biography": "Hi, I'm [Jorge] and I'm from Valencia, Spain My background is in Cartography and Geodesy Engineering, and I develop my professional career around Geospatial Information Systems and Open Source Software and Data.

The core idea is that data is only processed when required, thereby avoiding unnecessary computations. While setting up a dask-geomodeling computation, there is instant feedback of the result. This results in a fast feedback loop in the (geo) data scientist\u2019s\u2019 work. Big datasets can be processed by parallelizing multiple data queries, both on a single machine or on a distributed system. \r\n\r\n### Abstract \r\nIn geographical information systems (GIS), we often deal with data pipelines to derive map layers from various datasets. For instance, a water depth map is computed by subtracting the digital elevation map (DEM) from a water level map. These procedures are often done using open source products such as PostGIS and QGIS. However, for medium to large datasets (> 10 GB) the extent of these analyses are costly due to memory restrictions and computational cost. As a rule, these issues are tackled by manually cutting the dataset into smaller parts. However, this is a tedious and time-consuming task. In case one needs to this regularly, this is not feasible. \r\n\r\nWe present the open source Python library *dask-geomodeling* [1] to solve this issue. Instead of a script, dask-geomodeling requires a so-called \u201cgraph\u201d, which is the definition of all operations that are required to compute the derived dataset. This graph is generated by plain Python code, for instance: \r\n\r\n```\r\nplus_one = RasterFileSource('path/to/tiff') + 1 \r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that these operations are lazy: there is no actual computation done and therefore the above line executes fast. Only when actual data is requested: \r\n\r\n```\r\nplus_one.get_data( \r\n    bbox=(155000, 463000, 156000, 464000), \r\n    projection='epsg:28992', width=1000, height=1000 \r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn array containing the data is computed. No need to load the whole TIFF-file in memory if you only use a small part! \r\n\r\nThe computation occurs in two steps. First, a computational graph is generated containing the required functions. While generating the computational graph, the operations may be chunked into smaller parts. Second, this graph is evaluated by *dask* [2], using any scheduler (single thread, multithreading, multiprocessing, distributed) that is provided dask. \r\n\r\nThis library is open source under the name \u201cdask-geomodeling\u201d and is distributed on Github, PyPI, and Anaconda. A hosted cloud version is also available under the name Lizard Geoblocks [3]. Currently, we have implemented a range of operations for rasters, vectors, and combinations. The community is welcome to use our library, benefit from it, and expand it! \r\n\r\nReferences \r\n\r\n1. dask-geomodeling, https://github.com/nens/dask-geomodeling, https://dask-geomodeling.readthedocs.io/ \r\n2. dask, https://dask.org/\r\n3.

The team\u2019s work producing safety analysis for projects and programs typically involves merging data from a variety of sources with collision data, asset data, and/or program data. The bulk of the analysis is performed in PostgreSQL databases all with a geospatial component. The work necessitates ingesting input data from other databases, csv/excel files, and various geospatial data formats. It is critical that the analysis be documented and repeatable. \r\n\r\nMoving data around, getting external data into the database, transforming it, geocoding it etc., previously occupied the bulk of the team\u2019s time before, reducing capacity for the actual analysis. Additionally the volume of one-off and exploratory analyses resulted in a cluttered database environment with multiple versions of datasets with unclear lineage and state of completeness. \r\nModeled on the infrastructure as code idea, we began building a python library that would allow us to preserve the entire analysis workflow from data ingestion to analysis and to output generation in a single python file or Jupyter notebook.  The library began as a way to reduce the friction and standardize the process of ingesting external data into the various database environments utilized. It has since grown into the primary method to facilitate reproducible data analysis processes that includes the data ingestion, transformation, analysis, and output generation.\r\n\r\nThe library includes basic database connections, and facilitates quick and easy import and export from flat files, geospatial data files, and other databases. It provides both inferred and defined schemas, to allow both quick exploration and more thoroughly defined data pipeline processes.  The library includes standardization of column naming, comments, and permissions. There are built in database cleaning processes, geocoding processes, and we have started building simple geospatial data display functions for exploratory analysis. The code is heavily reliant on numpy, pandas, GDAL/ogr2ogr, pyodbc, psycopg2, shapely, and basic sql and python. The library is not an ORM, but occupies a similar role, but geared towards analytic workflows.\r\n\r\nThe talk will discuss how the library has evolved over time, the functionality and use cases in the team\u2019s daily workflows as well as where we would like to extend the functionality and open it up for contributions.  While the library is not currently open source, we are actively working on creating an open version and migrating to Python 3.x. This library has greatly improved the speed and simplicity of conducting exploratory analysis and enhanced the quality and completeness of the documentation of our more substantial data analytics and research.\r\nThe library should be of interest and utility for anyone working with data without the support of a dedicated data engineering team to facilitate the collection of multiple datasets from a variety of formats, as well as anyone looking to standardize their data analysis workflows from beginning to end.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "75770cb3-d4fa-54e6-ae00-9be04d4473f5", "id": 51, "code": "S9CLC8", "public_name": "seth hosteter", "avatar": null, "biography": "Seth Hostetter is the Director of Data Operations Systems and Analytics at the New York City Department of Transportation.

While higher resolution data is generally available within government agencies, access for external researchers is limited due to well-established privacy concerns. Inspired by our own use case of developing a regional quality of life metric for neighborhoods in Denmark, our team at Aalborg University\u2019s Department of the Built Environment, in collaboration with data.org\u2019s Growth and Recovery Challenge, and Data Clinic, set out to develop and open source not only foundational granular spatial units and data that adhere to privacy laws, but also the accompanying methodology that has the potential for broad applicability in other countries. \r\n \r\nIn this presentation, we will demonstrate the methodology\u2019s generalizability, particularly across common European land use and geographical features, and show how the resulting high-resolution shape files and community data can become crucial tools for government decision-makers, community organizations, and researchers in their efforts to increase transparency and engage in practical, actionable research.\r\n \r\nFocused initially on our Denmark use case, we algorithmically create spatial units with minimum household and population counts from country-wide hectare cell level data. Our approach uses data on road networks and administrative boundaries to create socially meaningful component polygons. This is achieved by developing tools based on already existing open source packages available in R and Python. The hectare cells are then mapped onto the polygons and clustered using the max-p regionalization algorithm with constraints on the minimum population and household counts to arrive at the final set of spatial units. \r\n \r\nTo improve the accessibility of this data to not just researchers but also administrative decision-makers, community organizations, and the general public, we are developing an online tool to explore and visualize indicators within the resulting fine-grained regions such as disposable income, educational level, housing prices, migration rates, distances to public institutions, and labor market attachments in Denmark. Regional inequality in Denmark has increased over time, and with the help of this tool, we hope to provide the ability to study these key metrics both within and across municipal regions. In the development of the tool, we prioritize user feedback and common use cases to ensure both applicability and longevity.\r\n \r\nThis project has been developed with an open-source mindset by: 1) creating flexible open data resources that can adapt to a wide range of public use cases 2) open sourcing the methodology for use in other countries/regions and 3) enabling the use of existing open data and tools such as Open Street Maps, R and Python in the pipeline.\r\n \r\nWe firmly believe that the project has the potential to improve knowledge sharing and collaboration between GIS experts, decision-makers, researchers and the general public not only in Denmark, but also in Europe and beyond.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "ef915531-7ac3-5f25-9b14-2fba135b33fc", "id": 232, "code": "T3BBJV", "public_name": "Sixten Maximillian Thestrup", "avatar": "https://talks.osgeo.org/media/avatars/profile-circle_3bweWJg.png", "biography": "Postdoc at Aalborg University (BUILD), PhD in Social Statistics from the University of Manchester.\r\n\r\nFields of interest include: \r\n- Bayesian methods, structural equation modelling and spatial modelling.\r\n- Survey research methods and measurement invariance in the social and political sciences\r\n- Data visualisation and dashboards", "answers": []}, {"guid": "747df0f6-d7ab-56d0-9748-9b5084740751", "id": 773, "code": "WS7A8J", "public_name": "Elise Stenholt S\u00f8rensen", "avatar": null, "biography": null, "answers": []}, {"guid": "41454a8a-d960-59a9-9ab9-43d5336d20e1", "id": 822, "code": "L8U3HH", "public_name": "Erin Stein", "avatar": "https://talks.osgeo.org/media/avatars/20190520_RA_Two_Sigma_DataClinic_Headshots_0096_small_-_square_kpvowAl.jpg", "biography": "Head of Operations of Data Clinic | Two Sigma", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"url": "https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/WFLJKB/", "id": 477, "guid": "4f229220-e3db-58a6-b0f4-e0b4b74d7120", "date": "2022-08-25T18:00:00+02:00", "start": "18:00", "logo": null, "duration": "00:05", "room": "Room 4", "slug": "foss4g-2022-477-power-grid-mapping-in-west-africa-sierra-leone-", "title": "Power Grid Mapping In West Africa (Sierra Leone)", "subtitle": "", "track": "Use cases & applications", "type": "Lightning talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "This is a presentation about mapping of electricity poles in Sierra Leone with the use of open source geospatial tools.

For instance https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover/clc2018 contains 2,377,772 simple features among which we find 852 overlaps and 1420 invalid polygons. For this test I used \u201cESRI FGDB\u201d file and gdal for import to postgis.  We find such minor overlaps and gaps quite often, which might not be visible for the human eye. The problem here is that it covers up for real errors and makes difficult to enforce database integrity constraints for this.  Close parallel lines also seems to cause Topology Exception in many spatial libraries.\r\n\r\nA core problem with simple features is that they don't contain information about the relation they have with neighbor features, so integrity of such relations is hard to constraint. Another problem is mixing of old and new data in the payload from the client. This makes it hard and expensive to create clients, because you will need a full stack of spatial libraries and maybe a complete locked exact snapshot of your database on the client side. Another thing is that a common line may differ from client to client depending on spatial lib, snapTo usage, tolerance values and transport formats.\r\n\r\nIn 2022 many system are depending on live updates also for spatial data.  So it\u2019s big advantage to be able to provide a simple and \u201csecure\u201d API\u2019s with fast server side integrity constraints checks that can be used from a standard web browser. When we have this checks on server side we will secure the equal rules across different clients.\r\n\r\nIs there alternatives that can secure data integrity in a better way? Yes, for instance Postgis Topology. The big difference is that Postgis Topology has more open structure that is realized by using standard database relational features. This lower the complexity of the client and secures data integrity. In the talk \u201cUse Postgis Topology to secure data integrity, simple API and clean up messy simple feature datasets.\u201d we will dive more into the details off Postgis Topology\r\nBuilding an API for clients may be possible using simple features, but it would require expensive computations to ensure topological integrity but to solve problem with mixing of new and old borders parts can not be solved without breaking the polygon up into logical parts. Another thing is attribute handling, like if you place surface partly overlapping with another surface should that have an influence on the attributes on the new surface.\r\n\r\nWe need to focus more on data integrity and the complexity and cost of creating clients when using simple feature, because the demands for spatial data updated in real time from many different clients in a secure and consistent way will increase.

Herders use data on pasture and water availability to move their livestock and farmers need weather predictions to plan their planting. While satellite imagery has made much of this information readily accessible to the spatial community, few channels exist to transmit this information to herding communities. As a result, climate data has become more powerful than ever before, yet mostly inaccessible to those who depend on this information for their livelihoods.\r\n\r\nThis talk goes over the lessons of a programme that seeks to bridge this gap. GARBAL is a call center that uses Copernicus Earth Observation imagery and field data to provide farmers & herders with information on pasture, water and markets in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. GARBAL was first developed in 2015 and this talk will provide lessons from several years of practice.\r\n\r\nThe GARBAL interface is built on mapserver and uses automated scripts to download and treat imagery from Sentinel 2 and Meteosat which then display information on pasture conditions and water availability. Field data is routed through a network of local data collectors who provide weekly updates on livestock conditions and market prices. In addition to an interactive map, the interface provides user-friendly textual outputs that summarize all the layers for any area of interest on the map, which allows call center agents to quickly provide data to callers. \r\n\r\nThe talk will share lessons from the technical and programmatic aspects of the project. The technical side will go over the architecture of the data treatment, demo the interface, talk about successes and failures and show how you can play with the data yourself.

These packages allow to work with all kind of data formats (e.g. GeoTIFF, NetCDF, ZARR) providing the data in array format (NumPy, xarray) and constitute a fundamental part of any scientific analysis or operational task. However, they do not offer full flexibility when working with Earth Observation (EO) datasets. The multidimensional complexity of EO data (i.e. space, time, bands) is often resolved by distributing dimensions across many files and thus not always easy to access. An important step forward to streamline EO data access has been the Open Data Cube (ODC) toolbox, which utilizes predefined dataset configurations and file-based indices stored in a database. With this setup, ODC enables an easy and uniform access to multidimensional geospatial datasets. Still, users are often confronted with a great variety of data formats, and files being distributed over different systems. This can pose a hurdle when working with ODC, especially if one wants to process a new stack of geospatial data, where the extra overhead of a database can stall swift progress.\r\n\r\nIn order to close this gap, the yeoda (''your earth observation data access'') Python software package aims to resolve this shortcoming by offering a similar interface as ODC, but allowing to interact with geospatial data on a lower level. It relies on two other Python software packages developed by TU Wien: geospade (definition of geospatial properties of a dataset, e.g. geometries), and veranda (read/write access to a variety of raster and vector data formats, e.g. GeoTIFF). This modular setup ensures a clear separation of concerns, specifically between geospatial operations and I/O tasks, yielding a homogenized interface independent from the actual data format. For example, geospatial operations based on tiled EO raster datasets can be easily performed across tile or file boundaries. Data access is then realised in veranda, which combines geometric properties with I/O objects listed in a table. On top of geospade and veranda, yeoda acts as a communication layer between files stored on the file system and data objects by adding additional dimensions to the data table, such as common metadata or file name entries. Thus, one can filter multiple files by their attributes (e.g. time, bands, variable names, satellite platform) before accessing the data.  \r\n\r\nHence, yeoda guarantees the necessary freedom to apply arbitrary algorithms on manifold data formats, while simultaneously supporting scalability by means of parallelised I/O operations.

Any inaccurate local map data can lead to a direct negative impact on business metrics.\r\n\r\nSo how do we ensure that map inconsistencies are detected and fixed promptly to minimise interference of our services? When manual detection is labor intensive and not scalable to millions of road networks in vast regions, how can we effectively automate this at scale? \r\n\r\nThis talk is a story of how we, at Gojek, built a pipeline that uses bad customer experience as the trigger to identify potentially faulty data in OpenStreetMap. Our solution makes use of noisy GPS traces and Overpass, an open source tool, to automate this detection. \r\n\r\nThis solution enabled us to identify 100s of potential issues per day, categorise them, associate business impact to each map issue and allow our map analysts to fix them seamlessly.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "828621f1-f833-51e1-b212-2435a61fea07", "id": 251, "code": "LXYVBD", "public_name": "Sriram Ravichandran", "avatar": null, "biography": "Full stack developer hailing from India.\r\n\r\nCurrently working at Gojek for the past 2 years, trying to provide the best tracking experience to customers.\r\n\r\nApart from work, I love drinking and experimenting with Coffee.", "answers": []}, {"guid": "d99693a5-b021-5a8d-b0e7-24c7c27e2e49", "id": 259, "code": "D37J9G", "public_name": "Chia Li Juan", "avatar": null, "biography": "Data Scientist @ Gojek Cartography", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"url": "https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/ALBXPD/", "id": 438, "guid": "61e58afd-ccb9-5077-bb4e-8b803a46bf2f", "date": "2022-08-25T15:20:00+02:00", "start": "15:20", "logo": null, "duration": "00:05", "room": "Modulo 0", "slug": "foss4g-2022-438-matico-a-new-federated-foss-platform-for-spatial-analysis-data-management-visualization-and-app-building", "title": "Matico a new federated FOSS platform for spatial analysis, data management, visualization, and app building", "subtitle": "", "track": "Use cases & applications", "type": "Lightning talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "Geospatial data and analysis is more central than ever to data science, research, and policy analyses.

However many of these powerful tools, like geopandas (analysis and modeling) and deck.gl (visualization)\u2014 are technically inaccessible to analysts and researchers without the available time or skills for advanced coding. A number of commercial ventures (Carto, ESRI etc) attempt to overcome this limitation by bringing these tools together as part of polished, graphical user interface driven platforms. While these platforms offer ease of use, they raise concerns about longevity, data ownership, and academic support.\r\n\r\nMatico is a new free and open-source platform we are developing at the Spatial Data Science center that seeks to fill the gap between open but technically focused tools and commercial platforms. Consisting of a suite of interoperable components, Matico enables organizations and individuals to manage and visualize their geospatial data while easily maintaining their own infrastructure. A backend server allows users to easily load, clean, analyze, and distribute data through APIs, queries, and in-browser data editing tools while a powerful app builder allows users to develop their own rich applications that target diverse audiences.\r\n\r\nThis talk will demonstrate the current features of Matico, our future roadmap , and demonstrate relevant use cases.

The management of long EO data time series of continuing or historic missions, with more than 20 years of data available already today, requires technical solutions and technologies which differ considerably from the ones exploited by existing systems. \r\n\r\nThe ESA project LOOSE (Technologies for the Management of LOng EO Data Time Series) enables investigating, testing and implementing new technologies to support long time series processing. \r\n\r\nFor specific tasks (such as ingestion, discovery, access, processing, analysis of EO data) a multitude of completely different mature open source components is usually available. LOOSE aims at combining functionally similar solutions from different heritages into one comprehensive framework. LOOSE even supports parallelism in a way that multiple solutions for the identical task are available and the application developer is invited to chose between these different components during implementation (e. g. \"GeoServer\" versus \"EOXServer\"). \r\n\r\nIn addition, LOOSE partners extended well-known existing components with new capabilities (=interfaces) to support efficient ingestion, discovery, exploitation optimized access, processing and optimized analysis of EO data timeseries. For example, GeoServer was extended with the capability to handle STAC metadata. \r\n\r\nOverall outcome of the project is a \"blueprint architecture concept\" which focuses on the interfaces between components and takes innovative concepts such as Bulk data retrieval from dedicated archives, OGC's Data Analysis Processing API and Data Cubes offering Discrete Global Grid Systems into consideration (see enclosed viewgraph).\r\n\r\nThe LOOSE system architecture is inspired by the EO Exploitation Platform Common Architecture (EOEPCA) and focuses on the technological evolution of selected services that enable the end-to-end workflow from retrieving long-term archived EO products to the extraction of high-level information based on processed value-added datasets. Architecture and interoperability are evaluated within LOOSE by using different implementations of these services (e.g. EOxServer and GeoServer) and deploying the whole system on two different infrastructures (DLR/LRZ and Mundi/OTC). The complete LOOSE infrastructure is built on Kubernetes and is therefore well transferrable between different cloud providers.\r\n\r\nThe validity of the LOOSE blueprint architecture is demonstrated in three different real-world application pilots.\r\nThese applications are covering totally different thematic areas: \r\n- Agricultural monitoring (based on Sentinel-1 and -2 data), \r\n- monitoring urbanization globally (also based on Sentinel-1 and -2) and \r\n- supporting fishery in the Black Sea (multi sensor approach, including in situ-data).\r\n\r\nLOOSE partners are DLR (Oberpfaffenhofen), EOX (Vienna), Terrasigna (Bucharest) and Mundialis (Bonn).", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "a68d7b55-3836-5115-ad6d-3028d607e858", "id": 431, "code": "WVERQR", "public_name": "Vasile Cr\u0103ciunescu", "avatar": "https://talks.osgeo.org/media/avatars/vasile_craciunescu-bv_mIVTPkm.jpeg", "biography": "Vasile Craciunescu is a researcher with more than 20 years experience, working for the MeteoRomania and Terrasigna, being in charge with the scientific and operational activities related to rapid mapping, spatial data infrastructure and webmapping.

We will also give an outlook about our activities towards getting Masterportal becoming an OSGeo project in the future.\r\n\r\nDriven by the succeeding trend of Open Governmental Data and the resulting needs for easy-to-use data platforms, the Masterportal (published under MIT license) sucscessfully developed into a powerful, customizeable Open Source solution for the visualization of geospatial data within the past years.\r\n\r\nIn order to build up a user and development community, the Masterportal Implementation Partnership was founded in 2018. This organization actually includes 35 public administration partners at the federal, state, and local levels in German-speaking countries (as of 02/2022). The most important committees of the Implementation Partnership are:\r\n\r\n* Strategic Committee (steers and controls the strategic direction of the master portal)\r\n* Technical Committee (supports the Strategic Committee in technical issues)\r\n* Product maintenance (technical further development, release management, etc.)\r\n* Maintainergroup (supports the product maintenance in technical further development, processing of PullRequests etc.)\r\n* Product Management (coordinates organizational matters, public relations, event planning, etc.)\r\n\r\nIn addition to regularly committee meetings, various workshops are organized, for example on the initial setup of the software or on special technical topics such as the integration of secure geodata services.\r\n\r\nBeside the partners from the public administration side, there are various companies, that offer support and maintenance  and contribute to the further development of Masterportal.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical point of view, the code is mainly based on OpenLayers, Vue.js and Bootstrap, while a wide range of modern ES6 libraries are used within the development. There are accurate and helpful development guide lines and code convention to ensure a reasonable code quality.\r\n\r\nWithout any further programming skills, a beginner may easily setup and configure a feature-rich modern WebGIS portal  including also an individual design. The configuration is done in a application context file, which is defined in JSON-format. Besides well-known features like printing, common map interactions, layer management, routing, search or drawing, Masterportal also supports all common OGC-Standards including WMS-Time and SensorThings API and the integration of metadata records.\r\n\r\nAlso, Masterportal serves as an underlying software basis for more individual projects  - therefore the addon concept allows maintainers to add further individual functionality, like special tools or individual feature info themes.\r\n\r\nThe talk will introduce the project and show some examples from real world clients, build upon Masterportal.\r\n\r\nTwitter Link: [twitter.com/masterportalorg](https://twitter.com/masterportalorg)  \r\nCode, Documentation:  [bitbucket.org/geowerkstatt-hamburg/masterportal/](https://bitbucket.org/geowerkstatt-hamburg/masterportal/)", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "32af3656-aac1-5ba0-924b-7fda914c308a", "id": 461, "code": "3UPTTD", "public_name": "Hannes Blitza", "avatar": "https://talks.osgeo.org/media/avatars/hbl_profil_NMCngxE.jpg", "biography": "Learned Geographer (University of Marburg and Bonn).

Investors are exposed to those risks through their investee companies given their dependence on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Therefore, just recently the financial community has started to pay attention to the economic and financial consequences of biodiversity loss. However, a key challenge is that a conceptual framework for measuring and understanding biodiversity-related financial risks (physical and transition risks) is less advanced than for climate-related financial risks. Thus the topic of biodiversity and corresponding risks is gaining momentum and methodologies how to assess them are being developed. In this context and due to the mounting pressure of biodiversity loss numerous frameworks like the EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities or the Task Force on Nature related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) have recently been created that try to curb these effects at scale. The intention of the international community is to channel investments to business ventures that do not harm biodiversity or ideally even regenerate it while investors are generally interested in minimizing their risks. To this end a consortium of financial specialists, biodiversity experts and remote sensing data analysts is developing a methodology and prototypical platform, initiated by WWF Switzerland, that quantifies the physical risks, i. e. risks associated with degrading ecosystem services (at the site level subject to data availability). Part of the innovation is to quantify ecosystem service dynamics at asset locations, i. e. the locations where companies actually produce their goods. The production sites and related activities are analyzed with regard to their dependency on five ecosystem services, namely (i) surface water, (ii) flood and storm protection, (iii) pollination, (iv) fiber & other materials and (v) climate regulation to quantify the physical risk at these locations by means of an index. This presentation focuses on the physical risk module, where EO data products represent a valuable source of information. The module builds on fundamental work done in the ENCORE project, in which the relationships between drivers of environmental change, natural capital assets, ecosystem services and production processes have been described exhaustively for the entire economy. Additionally, established databases containing information on the status of natural capital assets, e.g. the WRI Aqueduct 3.0 dataset on the spatial distribution of water-related risks, are used as a baseline against which other data can be compared. Up-to-date EO data products are then used to assess drivers of environmental change to investigate dynamics and trends, and to identify potential threats to the natural capital assets and the provisioning of corresponding economy-relevant ecosystem services. Here, we focus on drivers responsible for biodiversity loss, for example by using annual global land cover data from the Copernicus Global Land Service to assess habitat modification due to land cover change.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "2ed12fcf-5b32-5cec-bc1f-39befcde3d2c", "id": 448, "code": "A7JHH3", "public_name": "Hinrich Paulsen", "avatar": null, "biography": "Co-founder of terrestris and mundialis from Bonn, Germany, Hinrich has spent the past 20 years in the geoinformatics sector dedicated to supporting the development of Free and Open Source Software.

GeoStyler is an OSGeo community project [2] and received a lot of new features and changes in the past months.\r\n\r\nGeoStyler  provides a set of parser libraries that allow the conversion between different styling formats. On top of the core functionality GeoStyler provides an user interface library that helps to integrate GeoStyler into your own web application. Using these components, GeoStyler can be used for example to create a WYSIWYG style editor. The project also maintains a GeoServer-plugin [3], which includes styling UI-components into GeoServer. \r\nTwo more tools from the GeoStyler universe should be mentioned: A commandline interface (CLI) and a REST interface. The CLI provides a tool for server-side style conversion for an arbitrary number of style files \u2013 completely automated. The REST interface can be used to create web services which do the conversion between formats. With these tools, it is possible to convert a huge amount of QGIS styles to SLD, or Mapfile or any other supported file based styling format and vice versa.\r\nGeoStyler is based on a plugin concept, so the UI works with any of the supported parsers and can thereby be used for projects that use SLD, OpenLayers, QML, etc. Currently, GeoStyler supports the styling formats OGC SLD, OpenLayers Styles, Mapfiles, QML, Mapbox and also \u2013 for assistence when styling by attributes \u2013 the geodata formats GeoJSON, OGC WFS and Shapefile. Common Query Language (CQL) for filtering is understood as well as filter encoding (OGC FE).\r\nThere are a number of new features such as a card layout, enhanced support of expressions, filter UI enhancements as well as various documentation updates and translations planned for this year and we expect all or most to be realized when FOSS4G 2022 takes place.\r\nWith this talk, we want to present the current project status and show how GeoStyler evolved since the last talk.

However this is usually not the case, especially where the construction of these pipelines predates advances in mapping, geoinformation and database where they in prior existed as drawing and engineering plans. In order to migrate to a fully documented inventory, digitalisation and management of a water supply network database to estimate demand and supplies to plan expansion and population growth, there needs to be an inventory of existing scheme. Historically, mapping has been done with expensive mapping and survey equipment that can pose a challenge for small organisation\u2019s budget, making it difficult to have a complete mapping inventory of its network. \r\nThis article presents a geographical information system\u2013based free and opensource software architecture for the mapping and inventory of urban water supply network. This architecture is especially useful where budget is tight and decision relating to meeting the water and sanitation-related Sustainable Development goals needs to be made. The architecture consists of data management, data collection, data analysis and project host environment tools and software. \r\nPostGresSQL with PostGIS was used for design and management of water supply network GIS database, basing the creation and design of features and attributes on prior knowledge of what exists on water supply networks. Features created are transmission and distribution pipelines, hydrants, valves, chambers, junctions, leaks, encroachments, pumps, pump stations, reservoirs, bulk flowmeter, treatment stations with attributes across that include diameter, pipeline material, operational status, condition, encroachment, photo; sizes, capacity, models, manufacturer etc. The PostGIS database was connected to a QGIS project environment where custom forms to were designed to capture attributes created in PostGIS. The QGIS project was linked to an android based mobile app data collection software called Qfield, hosting custom forms designed in QGIS to capture the content of the water supply features, location and attributes. Using the form on Qfield, the water supply network is mapped and attributes captured and once data capture has been carried out using Qfield software, data from field capture is synchronised to QGIS project and following edits to the data captured, it is updated to the PostGresSQL PostGIS database. QGIS software acting as the project host environment also functions as the software for mapping, visualising and analysis of data hosted and managed \r\nThe architecture presented is an opportunity for any organisation seeking a free and open source GIS option in capturing and documenting and managing their water supply network data. As one of the weaknesses, is that data captured using Qfield has the inherent horizontal and vertical accuracy acquired from android devices which is less accuracy than that from a survey equipment. However, Qfield has the option of connecting to GNSS equipment by blue tooth, inheriting the sub cm horizontal and vertical accuracy it offers and thus improving locational and elevation information and still offering a higher accuracy free open source option.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "70f42139-6f1a-5952-a9c6-1cb582a2df63", "id": 358, "code": "A9QEZF", "public_name": "Anthonia Ijeoma Onyeahialam", "avatar": null, "biography": "Earth Observation and GIS Scientist", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"url": "https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/3DWDPJ/", "id": 373, "guid": "3f356ce6-9d8e-53d2-8b24-3303de2fbe10", "date": "2022-08-25T15:25:00+02:00", "start": "15:25", "logo": null, "duration": "00:05", "room": "General online", "slug": "foss4g-2022-373-impact-of-rainfall-variability-on-vegetation-phenology-cycle-in-niger-delta-region-using-qgis-graphical-modeler", "title": "Impact of Rainfall variability on Vegetation Phenology cycle in Niger Delta Region Using QGIS Graphical Modeler", "subtitle": "", "track": "Use cases & applications", "type": "Lightning talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "For decades, the open source community has made an enormous contribution to remote sensing in terms of tools and solutions, leading to support and inspiration for research.Open source software packages capable of processing digital images have increased the availability of remote sensing datasets. QGIS is an open source software package involving experts and users from around the world. QGIS is a useful tool for spatial visualization and analysis, making it a viable alternative to other costly software packages. It has became an effective tool for processing   and analysing the climate  data, based on the potentiality and flexibility  of graphical modeler imbedded plugin. Therefore, the aim of this work is to assess impact of Rainfall variability on Vegetation Phenology cycle  in Niger Delta from 2010 to 2019 using Open source QGIS graphical Modeler. The rainfall data was collected from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM).The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data MOD11A1 of 2010-2020 were download for two years intervals from the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website. The QGIS Graphical  modeler  was built using arithmetical expression and raster calculation geoprosessing tool to convert the modis data to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI) and Rainfall variability from TRMM . The mean Rainfall  and NDVI were extracted using the administrative boundary shapefile of the study area. The results were presented in figures, maps and graphs, and they show that Rainfall Variation have occurred with considerable impacts on the vegetation phenology cycle in Nigeria between 2010 and 2020. Rainfall data and NDVI indicate a high correlation with vegetation with the implication that as rainfall increased, the vegetation also increased and inversely. In view of the above findings and observations, the occurrence of rainfall variability and its grave impact in Nigeria has been empirically determined. Therefore, while the use of remote sensing and GIS technique in continuous monitoring of climatic indices and vegetation phenology cycles are highly recommended, The open source software should also be highly encouraged and freely made available for scientific research.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "f561d9ae-f278-52b3-a994-3b6e6b98b970", "id": 388, "code": "ZDTQFH", "public_name": "Lamidi souleman", "avatar": null, "biography": "Mr. Souleman Lamidi is a geoinformatics and surveying expert.

One of the biggest problems experienced is that the data for comprehensive analyzes are not accurate and powerful, and data formats change according to PT agencies. To solve these problems, PT data formats and visualization methods have been investigated.\r\n\r\nGTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) is the most commonly used format for specifying PT schedules,line,stop and route. In other words, GTFS is a data specification that allows PT agencies to publish their transit data in a format that can be consumed by a wide variety of software applications. Today, the GTFS data format is used by thousands of PT providers.\r\n\r\nOur company has developed an open-source GIS-based GTFS editor using its knowledge in data analysis, big data, and data visualization in the field of PT. Within the scope of this study, firstly, open PT data (line, stop, schedule, etc.) were obtained from different municipalities and visualized using open source GIS applications such as QGIS, SAGA GIS, JOSM, GeoDa, and data quality evaluation was made. State of art in the field of ITS has been researched and open source GTFS editors have been studied.\r\n\r\nOpen source map servers such as GeoServer were used for sharing, editing and organizing stop & line maps produced in GIS applications. For geospatial data analysis, stop points were verified by using geopandas and shapely libraries. PostgreSQL database was used to store geo-based stop & line data and the PostGIS extension was used. PostGIS adds spatial capabilities to PostgreSQL so it can store, query, and manipulate spatial data. On the server side scripting, GeoAlchemy(an extension of SQLAlchemy) was used for working with spatial databases and geospatial queries. Turf was used for any spatial operations. It is a geospatial engine, and it includes spatial operations and helper functions. - MapboxGL: WebGL-powered library was used for interactive vector maps on the web application. To render more than 1k of stops & lines with high performance, WebGL powered geospatial visualization framework DeckGL was used. NebulaGL provides geospatial drawing and editing tools for lines. It was added for creating & editing routes from the map. Osm-Nominatim is a geocoding library. It allows users to find a stop address from a location.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the studies, the open source GTFS editor was developed, which will create a geographical base for PT planning and operational methods. The developed GIS-based editor provides fast and more effective PT management by enabling the visualization, creation and management of lines and stops of PT agencies with user-friendly interfaces.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "cf75d838-9997-536f-9099-37b85eaaac3c", "id": 379, "code": "HHYABN", "public_name": "Elif Karag\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f", "avatar": null, "biography": "She is an urban planner at Parabol.

In 2022, the Memorandum of Understanding between both organizations was updated - to pay tribute to ongoing and future activities.\r\n\r\nIn the initial MoU (2008), OGC and OSGeo agreed to work closely to coordinate with each other\u2019s memberships regarding new standards developments and standards changes that may be required as a result of open source programs. Another important aspect of the relationship is to keep each other well informed of the respective activities and directions. Both aspects have proven to be of great importance. One goal was and is to coordinate activities in such a way as to maximize the achievement of both organizations\u2019 mission and goals.\r\nThat includes to identify open source technologies that can be used as reference implementations for and validate compliance tests developed for OGC adopted standards.\r\nSince the first MOU, there has been an increase in OGC on developer focus and engagement of software communities and activities.  Increased collaboration has also occured by way of the OGC API code sprints. In addition, key opportunities for cross pollination have evolved given shared missions (FAIR data) and the viewpoint that FOSS4G software is beneficial for all software.\r\n\r\nThe development of the OGC API suite of standards is an excellent example on how the MoU works in practical terms. The OGC APIs are a family of Web APIs that have been created as extensible specifications designed as modular building blocks that enable access to spatial data that can be used in data APIs. These revolutionary APIs make location information more accessible than ever before through the use of RESTful principles, and the OpenAPI specification for describing interfaces. OGC APIs have been tested in close collaboration with the global developer and end user communities through hackathons, sprints, and workshops to provide a modern solution to tomorrow\u2019s location sharing issues. For example, the 2021 Joint Code Sprint organized by OGC, OSGeo and the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) included open source implementations of OGC APIs - and became a standing sprint activity that was repeated in 2022.\r\n\r\nThis presentation provides a deeper dive into the new Memorandum of Understanding and how both open standards and  free and open source software can benefit from one another.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "9428ef15-62ef-5dd8-b134-61bd98b184f5", "id": 14, "code": "H8LVLX", "public_name": "Tom Kralidis", "avatar": "https://talks.osgeo.org/media/avatars/83c097f0f3c7bcea5f7fb0eaf41b00a5_f51N24q.jpg", "biography": "Tom Kralidis is with the Meteorological Service of Canada and longtime contributor to FOSS4G.

Therefore, an integration of the Mapillary viewer in Lizmap Web Client has been proposed and developed; hence the survey was performed with a camera that uses front and back optics to have 360-degree photos.\r\nThe workflow consisted of four main tasks. The first step involved the photographic survey of the road network using a GoProFusion360 mounted on a car that took photos of the surrounding environments. The next step consisted in the processing of the images, stitching the front and the back photos in order to obtain a 360-degree panoramic image. This step has been automated through the development of a Python script together with the use of the available software of the camera from the command line. About 50000 photos were uploaded on the Mapillary platform. Images have been integrated into the Lizmap Web Client webGIS through the Mapillary viewer and utilities. The integration was achieved by developing a new feature  for Lizmap Web Client based on Mapillary JS, an Open Source library provided by Mapillary that helps developers interact with the Mapillary API.\r\nThe final result is a tool that makes the Public Administration able to navigate and reach the photos uploaded on Mapillary directly from a window in the webGIS.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "abdcc957-a46a-5039-9cb2-6244c2096ef4", "id": 450, "code": "9HUKUG", "public_name": "Francesco Bursi", "avatar": null, "biography": "Civil Eng\r\nworks in GIS field", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"url": "https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/TDDGJ9/", "id": 134, "guid": "c38b8394-56cf-5658-846e-78499773dd04", "date": "2022-08-26T12:00:00+02:00", "start": "12:00", "logo": null, "duration": "00:30", "room": "Room Limonaia", "slug": "foss4g-2022-134-developing-a-topographic-data-production-system-based-on-open-source", "title": "Developing a topographic data production system based on open source", "subtitle": "", "track": "Use cases & applications", "type": "General session talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "The National Land Survey (NLS) of Finland decided in the fall of 2020 to develop a national topographic data production system based on open source technologies and especially on QGIS client. Since then, many significant steps have been taken for us to be able to implement the MVP of the application for the mappers of the NLS at the start of 2024. Later on, we are planning to replace our digital elevation model production system with similar technologies which would enable us to replace the current mapping system by 2026. In this presentation I will talk about our system's architecture, the tools we are developing and furthermore, some insights that we have learned during this project.\r\n\r\nThe application's architecture is based heavily on Postgres, where we run the main database from which the national topographic maps are made. The operators can access the main database via Job management-plugin and modify the database objects on the client (QGIS). These modifications (inserts, updates, deletes) are saved in the operators' work database, from which they can register these changes to the main database.\r\n\r\nOur first challenge was to design how more than 150 operators of the NLS are able to work using the same main database. We decided to use the client-web service architecture. The benefit of that is that we can use QGIS as such as it is and we can build all of the functions required for job management into the backend application. The job management plugin communicates with the web service and the conflicts between the different work databases are handled by a separate tool. With the tool, an operator can solve conflicts that are created by another operator editing the same objects.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, we are integrating stereo compilation with QGIS, which will enable the operators to measure objects from 3D aerial stereoscopic photos. The next steps are to develop comprehensive tools for quality assurance and to improve basic QGIS tools for selecting, editing and digitizing objects. The problem is that we have over a hundred different layers, therefore the default way to choose the layer is not sufficient for the operator. We also want to develop tools for real time quality checking so that the mapper would immediately know if a quality error occurs, making the general workflow smoother.\r\n\r\nAlthough some of the components are custom-made, our purpose is to publish those components that we recognize to be useful for other QGIS users.

Many of those datasets were published through implementations of classic OGC Web Service standards. As time has gone past, the architecture of web applications has evolved, propelled by new Web and Internet standards. This evolution of web application architecture has led to a revolution in how geospatial datasets are published on the Web. To ensure that the revolution in geospatial data publication has interoperability at its core, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has developed a series of Web Application Programming Interface (API) standards. \r\n\r\nThe OGC API suite of standards is a family of specifications that have been designed as modular building blocks that spatially enable Web APIs that offer access to spatial data and implementations of geospatial algorithms. These revolutionary APIs make location information more accessible than ever before through the use of the OpenAPI specification for describing interfaces. The use of the OpenAPI specification means that implementations of OGC API Standards can describe themselves to levels of detail previously unachievable through the classic OGC Web Service standards. Such an ability to self-describe is significant because it has enabled software developers from a variety of disciplines to implement OGC API Standards to address the needs of their communities.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will provide an overview of the background, current status, and future plans for the development of OGC API Standards. The presentation will describe plans for the development of resources that improve the ability of developers to implement OGC API Standards.

It is used by software solutions and data providers to validate the conformity of geospatial data sets, metadata and APIs.\r\n\r\nFor example, ETF is the underlying framework used by the INSPIRE Reference Validator to validate INSPIRE metadata, datasets and services against the requirements of the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. ETF is also used extensively in Germany by the Surveying Authorities of the Laender to validate their datasets. This includes Real Estate Cadastral data, Topographic data, Control Points, 3D Building Models, House Coordinates and Building Polygons. In the test environments of the German Laender, a comprehensive series of attributive, relational, geometric, and topological tests are performed on the data, in addition to interacting with APIs and checking for errors in the interface contracts. Other European Union (EU) Member States are also reusing ETF to allow their data providers to test resources against national requirements. Finally, some software tools such as GeoNetwork open source include validation based on the ETF API in their workflow.\r\n\r\nGoals in designing the ETF software were to create test reports that are user-friendly and self-explanatory as well as to be able to validate large amounts of data, which can be several hundred GB in size. In order to cover different validation tasks and present them in a unified report, the architecture is modular and different Test Engines can be used. Currently the following Test Engines are supported: SoapUI for testing web services, BaseX database for testing XML data, Team Engine to validate WFS and OGC Web APIs using the OGC CITE tests, NeoTL Engine for testing WFS, OGC Web APIs and datasets. \r\n\r\nAs a horizontal and reusable tool, which could be extended to satisfy the needs of different communities and domains, ETF is currently considered as a component of the so-called Common Services Platform under the new Digital Europe Programme of the European Commission.

Released under the European Union Public License (EUPL) v.1.2 (https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry), it is a key component ensuring interoperability in data infrastructures.\r\nThe Re3gistry supports organizations in managing and updating \u201creference codes\u201d through unique identifiers. Reference codes can be used for example to define sets of permissible values for a data field or to provide a reference or context for the data being exchanged. Examples are enumerations, controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri or simply \u2018lists of things\u2019. The Re3gistry provides a means to assign identifiers to such items and their labels, definitions and descriptions in different languages. It provides a user-friendly interface where labels and descriptions for reference codes can be easily browsed by humans and retrieved by machines, including the possibility of downloading them in different formats and exploiting the information using a REST API.\r\nThe European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC) started the development of the Re3gistry in 2014 to satisfy the interoperability requirements set by the INSPIRE Directive. In 2020, considering the high reusability of the tool beyond INSPIRE, the JRC released the code as open source. So far, the development of the Re3gistry has been supported by the European Commission under the interoperability actions ARE3NA and ELISE and, more recently, by the National Land Survey of Finland.\r\nIn 2021, a second version of the Re3gistry software was released. This version v2.0, complemented by subsequent minor releases, introduced several new features such as a management interface to add and modify the status of items, and the capability to trace the full lifecycle of items following the workflow defined by ISO 19135 standard. The current stable release is v.2.3.0 released in March 2022. The INSPIRE registry (https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/registry) is currently the most popular implementation of the Re3gistry software. It is the central point of access to (currently) more than 7000 reference codes, available in 23 languages and several formats (HTML, ISO 19135 XML, JSON, RDF/XML, Re3gistry XML, CSV), grouped into different centrally managed INSPIRE registers. The content of these registers is based on the INSPIRE Directive, Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines (as illustration, used to reference INSPIRE themes, code lists and application schemas). \r\nThe Re3gistry is currently used by many organizations across European countries (Austria, Finland, France, Italy, Slovakia, Spain, The Netherlands and North Macedonia), different EU-funded projects and private organizations even outside Europe. Since 2021, the Re3gistry v.2.x is included in the OSGeo Live to facilitate discovery and use by the open source geospatial community. In 2022 the software will be also submitted as an OSGeo Community Project. \r\nSumming up, the Re3gistry is more relevant than ever to ensure semantical and organisational interoperability across any kind of systems, including Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs).", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "61e7244c-df09-562f-b567-9b72d4440d5b", "id": 514, "code": "XWGGBJ", "public_name": "Jordi Escriu", "avatar": null, "biography": "Geospatial data analyst, advocate for interoperability and open standards, with more than 17 years experience in the public sector.

I work as a senior data scientist at Blue Sky Analytics. We are a climate tech startup primarily focused on creating environmental datasets for better monitoring and climate risk assessment for various stakeholders across the globe. To achieve this, we are leveraging the potential of geospatial analytics by creating a catalogue of comprehensive and accurate climate data to drive sustainable decision-making. And all this is only possible because of the open-source tools & knowledge made publicly by the good folks organising the event.\r\n\r\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from biomass burning (which includes the combustion of forests, savannas, and croplands) play an important role in regional air quality, global climate change, and human health. In the year 2021, all the continents except Antarctica witnessed major wildfires. These enormous blazes some the size of a small country aren\u2019t just destroying native forests and vulnerable animal species. They\u2019re also releasing billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, potentially accelerating global warming and leading to even more fires. Accurate assessment of biomass burning emissions is paramount to understanding and modelling global climate change.\r\n\r\nBy combining open-source tools with geospatial data, we present a global dataset that estimates the total GHG emissions due to biomass burning globally. We achieved this by linking satellite-based fire observations, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and vegetation type (based on land cover classification) to directly estimate how much carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were emitted from each fire. We conducted further analysis of estimated emissions by comparing our estimates with existing datasets from NASA's global fire emissions database and ESA's Copernicus global fire assimilation system. Overall, our estimates agree well against both of these sources with an R2 score of 0.91, 0.71, and MAE score of 9, 14 MtCO2e/yr against GFEDv4.1s and GFASv1.2 respectively across 245 nations between 2015-2020. The dataset includes country-level estimates of gross GHG emissions across different vegetation types such as forest, cropland, shrubland, and grassland for the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nThe dataset is currently a work in progress as we aim to add more features such as covering other landcover types, ground truth alternatives.

We provide datasets through API spanning flood, drought, wildfire, heat risk for monitoring, measuring and mitigating climate risk which can be leveraged for various use-cases.\r\n\r\nIn 2 years, we have analyzed TBs of data, delivered 5 datasets & built platforms for data visualisation and distribution from scratch using FOSS technology. This has been a rocket-ship of a journey, chasing our mission of building a \u2018Bloomberg for environmental data\u2019.\r\n\r\nHowever, the not-so-secret sauce to achieving these milestones has been FOSS. We are often asked how we procure raw geospatial data and how much we spend on it. Thanks to the abundance of open data, our data acquisition cost has been 0. Due to the generous open data policy of amazing organisations like NASA & ESA, we have been able to build a business collecting TBs of data daily & crunching them into useful insights.\r\n\r\nThis helped us scale our vision to build a global environmental data stack for tracking climate change in real-time. Moreover, before this data can be applied to climate mitigation, it needs to be analysed. This is true for any big data and today, less than 1% of global data is analysed. \r\n\r\nGiven that satellite data is the most significant source of tracking climate variables, it became imperative to tap this source. We discovered that the path to providing environmental datasets was by building a powerful geospatial data refinery along with [SpaceTime\u2122](https://spacetime.blueskyhq.in/)  and our [dev portal](http://developer.blueskyhq.in).\r\n\r\nThere was limited infrastructure available to support the delivery of geospatial datasets so we built it, leveraging open-source tools like Postgres, QGis, GDAL, k8s etc.\r\n\r\nWhile we have proprietary layers to our models, as a team of young developers, data scientists and designers, many self-taught, our cultural ethos stands firmly with FOSS and we plan to be a leading contributor to FOSS for climate action. The most significant step for us in that direction has been providing annual, country-wise data on biomass emissions to the Al Gore-led [Climate TRACE](https://www.climatetrace.org/) inventory that can be used by the public via CC-BY-4.0 framework.\r\n\r\nAs our business expands, we aim to open-source tools & innovations we have internally developed while building our infrastructure and have started that journey with the [Raster Playground.](http://play.blueskyhq.in)\r\n\r\nClimate change is the most pressing challenge of our times, throwing at us various questions that need to be answered.

Annually, several research papers are published showing deep learning semantic segmentation-based methods to perform this kind of automated feature extraction. Unfortunately, many of those papers do not have open-source implementations for public usage, making it difficult for other researchers to access those implementations.\r\n\r\nHaving that in mind, we present DeepLearningTools and pytorch_segmentation_models_trainer. Both are openly available implementations of deep learning-based semantic segmentation. This way, we seek to strengthen the scientific community sharing our implementations.\r\n\r\nDeepLearningTools is a QGIS plugin that enables building and visualizing masks from vector data. Moreover, it allows the usage of inference web services published by pytorch_segmentation_models_trainer, creating a more feasible way for QGIS users to train Deep Learning Models.\r\n\r\npytorch_segmentation_models_trainer (pytorch-smt) is a Python framework built with PyTorch, PyTorch-Lightning, Hydra, segmentation_models.pytorch, rasterio, and shapely. This implementation enables using YAML files to perform segmentation mask building, model training, and inference. In particular, it ships pre-trained models for building footprint extraction and post-processing implementations to obtain clean geometries. In addition, one can deploy an inference service built using FastAPI and use it in either web-based applications or a QGIS plugin like DeepLearningTools.\r\n\r\nResNet-101 U-Net Frame Field, ResNet-101 DeepLabV3+ Frame Field, HRNet W48 OCR Frame Field, Modified PolyMapper (ModPolyMapper), and PolygonRNN are some of the models available in pytorch-smt.

This talk describes the process of designing and implementing the new registry management software and explores the suitability of QGIS as a platform for creating highly customised spatial data management tools. While the registry management tool is developed for QGIS, the registry is migrated from Oracle to a PostGIS database, following a redesign of the data model.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, the NLS announced it aims to build its technological environment based on open source technologies.

The scientific python community has developed a powerful stack for flexible, high-performance analytics of databcubes in the cloud. Xarray provides a core data model and API for analysis of such multidimensional array data. Combined with Zarr or TileDB for efficient storage in object stores (e.g. S3) and Dask for scaling out compute, these tools allow organizations to deploy analytics and machine learning solutions for both exploratory research and production in any cloud platform. Within the geosciences, the Pangeo open science community has advanced this architecture as the \u201cPangeo platform\u201d (http://pangeo.io/).\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a major barrier preventing the community from easily transitioning to this cloud-native way of working: the difficulty of bringing existing data into the cloud in analysis-ready, cloud-optimized (ARCO) format. Typical workflows for moving data to the cloud currently consist of either bulk transfers of files into object storage (with a major performance penalty on subsequent analytics) or bespoke, case-by-case conversions to cloud optimized formats such as TileDB or Zarr. The high cost of this toil is preventing the scientific community from realizing the full benefits of cloud computing. More generally, the outputs of the toil of preparing scientific data for efficient analysis are rarely shared in an open, collaborative way.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, we are building Pangeo Forge ( https://pangeo-forge.org/), the first open-source cloud-native ETL (extract / transform / load) platform focused on multidimensional scientific data. Pangeo Forge consists of two main elements. An open-source python package--pangeo_forge_recipes--makes it simple for users to define \u201crecipes\u201d for extracting many individual files, combining them along arbitrary dimensions, and depositing ARCO datasets into object storage. These recipes can be \u201ccompiled\u201d to run on many different distributed execution engines, including Dask, Prefect, and Apache Beam.

A country\u2019s development plays a huge factor in the quality of services its people receive, therefore not every country will receive the same quality of services.\r\nClassroom GIS has changed how Geography as an academic subject is taught. It has sparked interest in the practical component of the subject and gives more understanding to the strong relationship between theory and map work. This leads to the concept of spatial thinking and how it has allowed geography educators around the world, some without basic GIS education, to see the importance of including more GIS concepts in the high school geography curriculum.\r\nSeveral GIS software packages are available that educators can use to teach their students. But taking into account the availability of resources when focusing on the African continent, it is probable that free software and hardware plays a key role in the development of GIS concepts being included in the geography curriculum. It is affordable, and learning resources are readily available, in terms of tutorials, documentation and more.\r\n\u201cThis inclination towards GIS textbook lecturing has largely jeopardized the quality of GIS education\u201d. - (Fleischmann and van der Westhuizen, 2020 found in The Journal of Geography Education in Africa)\r\nAdvocacy to include GIS practices and strategies in geography education across Africa have been documented, but has not received the necessary exposure it needs from its governments. The majority of GIS teaching has been textbook-based, making the introduction of GIS technology and education a frightening phase that educators may not want to engage in.\r\nTo overcome the fears behind understanding and grasping basic GIS concepts in the classroom, interactive GIS tutorials may help to remove these fears and make the adoption of GIS simple, especially within countries where service delivery (education services) is poor. \r\nQGIS for example is an open-source GIS software that has been around for 20 years, it has shown tremendous improvements and upgrades throughout its 20 years. Its user-friendly capabilities have improved, making it ideal to introduce more geography educators and learners to the software. It has tutorials and material that is suited for individuals from different walks of the profession. \r\nThe tutorials are interactive and allow first-time users to readily engage with the material. For both learner and educator to understand the material and not get overwhelmed. The key factors to understand are; GIS can be implemented into the African geography school curriculum, open-source software is key to overcoming limitations such as lack of resources and geography educators are willing to take on GIS with sufficient training.

To support the growth of OSM communities in Tanzania, OpenMap Development Tanzania with her partner the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) awarded microgrants to seven OSM communities in Tanzania - See the supported communities here. \r\n\r\nThe grants provided are supporting these communities to leverage the use of OSM and mapping to help solve different community challenges by facilitating training/workshops, purchasing tools and equipment, supporting staff, and other logistics. Most communities work in peripheral regions with a minimal understanding and use of open data and mapping technologies like OpenStreetMap, OpenDataKit QGIS, etc.\r\n\r\nThe first phase of project implementation ended with great successes and lessons learned from these communities. The general success of the microgrants so far include the following: \r\n\r\n1. Transforming communities from using traditional data collection to digital open source tools such as ODK and Kobocollect has greatly improved data management and analysis. For instance, Agri Thamani Foundation and LAVISEHA are among microgrant recipients who are new to OpenStreetMap and other open mapping technologies for generating open data; however, they now use different tools, i.e. Kobotoolbox, OpenDataKit, OSM, and Tasking Manager, to collect data for their interventions in nutrition and gender-based violence.\r\n\r\n2. Connecting OSM communities in Tanzania and encouraging collaboration in various tasks and opportunities. The grant provided an opportunity for local OSM communities in Tanzania to work together; a good example is Hope for Girls and Women in Tanzania, giving training to LAVISEHA on how communities can use open source tools like ODK to report the cases of GBV for rescue.\r\n\r\n3. Creating awareness about OSM and other communities through participating and presenting in conferences and events such as the State of the Map Africa, Community webinars, etc.\r\n\r\n4. Over 16000 building footprints were mapped and 380 km of roads were uploaded to OpenStreetMap by grantees\r\n\r\n4. Supporting the growth of youth mappers chapters - Three grant recipients are youth mappers from three different universities who are using the grants to solidify the chapter and get exposure to projects while also applying for other funding to expand their projects\r\n\r\nAlthough the microgrant is expected to end in June 2022, OMDTZ is committed to supporting these communities through training and different engagements to ensure they achieve their goal of using open data for decision-making.

For Water Supply networks it is possible to work with demand scenarios (https://github.com/Giswater/giswater_dbmodel/wiki/epa-demand-scenarios) and for Urban Drainage projects it is possible to work with DWF scenarios (https: //github.com/Giswater/giswater_dbmodel/wiki/epa-dwf-scenarios) and hydrological scenarios (https://github.com/Giswater/giswater_dbmodel/wiki/epa-hydrology-scenarios)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it also allows working with alternatives to plan new elements of the network without interfering with the elements of the asset inventory. By creating an alternative (https://github.com/Giswater/giswater_dbmodel/wiki/masterplan-capabilities) you can modify the physical reality of the network without affecting the real assets at all.\r\n\r\nAnother especially interesting feature is that it allows collaborative work.

In Brazil there is a growing use of GeoNode, observed mainly in governmental institutions and universities. One of the main ways of installing and configuring GeoNode is the so-called Geonode Project. It consists of a custom Django Project template, which contains, in addition to the main project files, a set of Dockerfiles of GeoNode components, such as GeoServer, Nginx (reverse proxy) and PostGIS. From a detailed analysis of the components of the GeoNode Project created, it was found that the original dockerfiles contain a series of security holes and also unnecessary packages for the execution of the stack, not recommended for production environments. A Dockerfile that follows best practices eliminates the need to run privileged containers (as root), the use of unnecessary packages, leaked credentials, like mail passwords or database DSNs, or anything that could be used for an attack. Removing known risks in advance will reduce security management work and service overhead. The objective of this talk corresponds to discuss the possible security holes found in the Geonode Project and, with the application of best practices in Dockerfiles, to make it leaner and safer for production environments.

This means that the most efficient route to travel all roads and paths in the area can now be calculated within a defined polygon.\r\nThe CPP is a well-known problem from graph theory, where the goal is to visit every edge in a graph while minimizing the distance traveled. In theory, a graph can be either directed, undirected, or mixed.\r\n In this implementation, the CPP has been implemented for directed graphs, as this corresponds to the representation of graphs in Valhalla and the data structure of OpenStreetMap (OSM). The latter forms the data basis for the calculation of the CPP route.\r\nThe CPP is solved using the following set of algorithms: the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, the Hungarian method, and the Hierholzer method. After successfully implementing the theoretical code base of the CPP, the main challenge was to make the route calculation executable using real-world road networks (OSM).\r\nA key problem with the implementation of the theoretical CPP is that in real-world graphs, not every edge is always reachable by all other edges. Therefore, various extensions had to be made to allow the computation of a CPP route using OSM data. For example, within a larger area, rarely all road segments are accessible exclusively via the roads located in the area. It is often necessary to leave the area to access these otherwise inaccessible parts of the road network.\r\nEventually, we were able to create a working prototype of the CPP in Valhalla. In addition to the function of freely selecting the area to be traveled, restricted zones, so called no-go areas,  can also be defined. After selecting the vehicle type (car, bicycle, pedestrian, etc.), the CPP route can be calculated, which also includes turn-by-turn navigation.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "1576056c-cd53-5e2f-8764-f819ef6223d5", "id": 65, "code": "BDPNZK", "public_name": "Andreas Jobst", "avatar": null, "biography": "Project Manager at Camptocamp", "answers": []}, {"guid": "71459ae2-8d9e-51c0-8546-a0cbcd7f49d8", "id": 66, "code": "QX8FMS", "public_name": "Ismail Sunni", "avatar": null, "biography": "Geospatial Software Engineer (Camptocamp)", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"url": "https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/773JU8/", "id": 239, "guid": "a9a60efd-5b62-51aa-9bfe-bf37e43f365f", "date": "2022-08-26T12:00:00+02:00", "start": "12:00", "logo": null, "duration": "00:30", "room": "Modulo 0", "slug": "foss4g-2022-239-a-graph-based-road-conflation-method-preserving-connectivity", "title": "A Graph-Based Road Conflation Method Preserving Connectivity", "subtitle": "", "track": "State of software", "type": "General session talk", "language": "en", "abstract": "Connectivity of roads in a map is essential for many use cases including navigation.

Mobility management, pandemics\u2019 spreading, equal access to services and climate crisis are just some of the crucial issues that falls within the definition of urban resilience.\r\nOne very promising solution aiming to solve many of these issues has been presented in 2016 by Professor Carlos Moreno under the name of \u201c15-minutes city\u201d. The paradigm is based on the idea that every citizen should be able to reach the essential services (supermarkets, shops, parks, etc) walking not more than 15 minutes from their home. The model is being tested in some metropolitan cities around the world (e.g. Paris).\r\nHowever, reorganizing the city so that it presents a 15-minutes structure is not an easy task. It requires large resources and a careful planning based on data, to make sure that the project undertaken will actually have a positive effect on the urban mobility and no asset is wasted on useless projects.\r\nThe Business Innovation team of Dedagroup Public Services used Open Street Map data to develop an index to detect the local level of proximity within the city, showing both the areas that already conform to the 15 minutes model and the ones that do not, where taking action would improve the quality of life of the citizens living there.\r\nThe presentation will be focused on this proximity index, describing the assumptions behind its definition, such as the choice of city services to be considered essential, the nature of the road network used to compute walking distances and the area tiling chosen for the task.\r\nThe index will be then showcased on the city of Florence, together with an analysis of the city from a proximity point of view and a what if scenario: how would the index change if the municipality (and other relevant stakeholders) decided to make interventions on low proximity areas?\r\nThe case of Ferrara will be also presented to show that the proximity index can be the basis for further analyses: coupling the index with resident population count can help to spot the areas that are both under-served and highly populated, that are the ones where more people would benefit from improvements.", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"guid": "2105a2d2-cd54-5a36-bd79-a11a19210244", "id": 165, "code": "ZYHEHV", "public_name": "Piergiorgio Cipriano", "avatar": "https://talks.osgeo.org/media/avatars/pg_PYLWH8G.jpg", "biography": "I am a GIS/SDI analyst since 1998.\r\nWorking at Dedagroup Public Services since 2005 (form Sinergis), in 2012-2013 I have joined the Joint Research Centre of European Commission, on INSPIRE-related projects.\r\nI am passionate about maps, cartograms and storymaps, with focus on city-level data about air quality, energy performance of buildings, sustainable mobility.\r\nIn the last 7 years with my colleagues I was involved in several demonstration projects co-funded by EIT Climate-KIC, EIT Digital and Horizon2020 programs.\r\nFrom 2001 to 2010 I've been involved in ISO/TC211 and CEN/TC287 working groups on standards for geographic information and services.", "answers": []}, {"guid": "b67c4f26-23b5-5e2a-8ed2-e4f9aad2d7a0", "id": 185, "code": "Z87GNU", "public_name": "Beatrice Olivari", "avatar": null, "biography": "I'm full stack developer at Dedagroup Public Services in the Business Innovation & Development's team.

Many companies and governmental institutions have transferred their data and results into open source web platforms or tools for public access.\r\n\r\nWithin the broad topic of the interaction between renewable energy and environment, over the last years RSE S.p.A. has faced the necessity to develop and maintain WebGIS and online platforms related to various aspects of the energy system, in order to characterize the territory and its possible influences on renewable energy sources integration in the energy system, thus supporting the decision-making process towards energy transition.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant products is the Integrated Atlas for the National Energy System and Renewable Sources, a WebGIS platform which represents on a national scale significant variables of the energy sector (resources, demand, installed plants, territorial constraints) under a system view, with the principal aim of supporting energy planning. From a technical point of view the Integrated Atlas is developed on TerriaMap, a catalogue-based web geospatial visualisation platform developed by the Australian research centre CSIRO. TerriaMap uses the JavaScript library TerriaJS together with other open source libraries as React JS, Leaflet and Cesium, for 3D visualization.\r\n\r\nBesides standard WebGIS functionalities, the Integrated Atlas provides the access to TOTEM (Territory Overview Tool for Energy Models), an advanced open source tool for the energetical characterization of the territory, essential for supporting multi-energy modelling. Starting from spatial and energy data, the TOTEM tool estimates electrical and heat demand, wind and solar resource and other significant energy variables on hourly and provincial scale. Concerning technical details, the tool and its web interface are developed in Python and use libraries such as Pandas, Flask ad Bokeh. The tool is opensource and it will be release under MIT License, however only a portion of the input data are currently publicly available due to data providers\u2019 restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe need to harmonize data and analysis about the relations between energy and environment and provide an access point to the developed tools has inspired the creation of the Energy and Environment Geoportal, based on the Mapstore Open Source web platform developed by GeoSolutions. This platform allows viewing and querying geospatial published data, integrating different remote resources into interactive and immediate representations such as maps, dashboard or geostories.\r\n\r\nAs an example, detailed results of above cited multi-energy models, which receive spatialized energy data as inputs, have been synthesized in a geostory, an immersive narration which explains how a multi-energy analysis based on detailed territorial characterization of a region can support the evaluation of the best alternatives for its energy development. The geostory is accessible from the Energy and Environment Geoportal.\r\n\r\nIt must be specified that these products are still under development and subject to continuous updates of both data and technology.

Although these impacts can vary as a result of physical and hydroclimatic conditions in watersheds, over the past decades a simple metric known as equivalent clearcut area (ECA) has emerged to quantify the cumulative disturbance at any point in time in a watershed, accounting for the temporal dynamics, including recovery, of historical disturbance. \r\nECA is widely used as an indicator to quantify forest disturbances as it not only covers all disturbance types but also considers the subsequent recovery of these disturbed areas through space and time. An ECA coefficient of 100% means there is no hydrological recovery due to planting trees, on the other hand, an ECA of 0% means 100% of the disturbed area has reached its maximum potential in recovery. \r\nThe prime objective of this project was to generate an annual time series of ECA for every watershed within the area covered by the Nadina Natural Resource District in British Columbia, Canada. The disturbance types identified in this project were forest fire, timber harvest, pest infestation, and permanent infrastructure development. The time and location of these disturbances were integrated with the BC Freshwater Atlas, in order to provide quantitative estimates of ECA for the watershed associated with stream reaches in the study area. \r\nDue to the cumulative nature of ECA over space and time, all types of forest disturbances have to be combined and recovery factors must be applied to account for vegetation and hydrological recovery over time. Previous field research was used to find the relationship between the tree stand height and the age following logging. \r\nIn order to apply the methodology, open source data and tools were used. We used two publicly available global satellite image derived raster products of forest change for our initial disturbance data source. We updated the forest change raster products using GDAL with local public geospatial datasets to assign change types for each year from 1985-2020, creating a unified multiband raster of change. The multiband raster was processed within Python, using GDAL and NumPy libraries, and recovery factors were applied to each pixel dynamically based on the year and type of change. The result of this processing was a collection of time series for watersheds broken down by year and type of change present. \r\nThe ECA results for the study area were loaded into PostGreSQL for delivery to a web application that allows a user to compare a location\u2019s ECA with the forest disturbance input. The application relies on Mapbox GL to interact with a web map and the spatial data display of the forest disturbance locations. D3 and Crossfilter JS libraries were used to interact with the disturbance data, allowing a user to filter histograms based on a variety of attributes, which are reflected in the histograms and web map in real time.

The rapid identification of both vehicles and road networks directly from overhead imagery allows a host of problems to be tackled, such as congestion mitigation, optimized logistics, evacuation routing, etc.  Such challenges often arise in the aftermath of natural disasters, but are also present in crises like the current invasion of Ukraine where roads are choked with civilians fleeing the fighting.\r\n\r\nAutomobiles provide an attactive proxy for human popuplation due to their mobile nature and the necessity of population movement in many disaster scenarios.  In this project, we deploy the YOLTv5 computer vision object detection codebase to rapidly identify and geolocate vehicles over large areas. Vehicle detections yield significantly greater utility when combined with road network data. We use the CRESI computer vision framework to extract up-to-date road networks with travel time estimates, thus permitting optimized routing. The CRESI codebase is able to extract roads using only overhead imagery, so flooded areas or obstructed roadways will sever the CRESI road graph; this is crucial for post-disaster scenarios where existing road maps may be out of date and the route suggested by cloud navigation services may be impassable or hazardous.\r\n\r\nDiet Hadrade provides a number of graph theory analytics that combine the CRESI road graph with YOLTv5 locations of vehicles. We combine the car detections with the road network to infer how congested certain areas are. Congestion information is important for everyday life, but also crucially important in disaster response scenarios when roads may become impassable due to both natural phenomena as well as traffic.  \r\n\r\nWe leverage the detailed road graph and vehicle location information to illustrate a number of scenarios, such as: bulk evacutation, optimal aid disbursement locations, critical intersections, and detection and automated avoidance of dangerous locales.

More than three Petabytes of Earth observation (EO) data covering the African continent are routinely updated and made available for free.\r\n \r\nThis talk will explore how cloud native geospatial technologies, such as the Cloud Optimised GeoTIFF data storage format and Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog metadata standard, enable us to more easily organise, share and analyse these petabytes of data. We\u2019ll discuss how we work with the global EO community to develop standards that enable federation and interoperability. And we\u2019ll demonstrate how DE Africa has been able to to build capacity across Africa, from enabling individuals to run scientific analyses through to assisting national space agencies set up their own platform and supporting industry to deliver innovative products on top of our service.\r\n\r\nWe will conclude with covering key lessons learnt in building the DE Africa platform, and look to the future, as we transition to African-led operations.
