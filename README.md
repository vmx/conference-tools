Tools for organizing conferences
================================

This is a repository with tools and scripts I assembled over the years. It's centred around [pretalx], the best system to organize a conference I know of.

The [`seafile` subdirectory] contains scripts to run a conference with pre-recorded talks. It was created during COVID times and was successfully used by the [FOSSGIS conference] in 2021 and 2022 (thanks [@britiger] for making the tools ready for 2022).
